> Altamura Man lived between around 130,000 and 170,000 years ago,  according to scientists. This period is marked by the transition between  Homoheidelbergensisand the Neanderthals, but the Italian specimen  does not appear to fall neatly into either category.

> Probes were used for a "virtual excavation" of the skull and the  information gathered helped the team create a digital reconstruction of  the complete cranium. This allowed the scientists to examine the shape  of the cranium as a whole, in detail, for the first time.
