> Haemochromatosis is an inherited iron overload disorder caused by a mutation to the HFE gene, it has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. If a male with haemochromatosis (who is otherwise healthy) has children with a healthy heterozygous female who is also a carrier for haemophilia (X-linked recessive), what are the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of their children wrt haemochromatosis & haemophilia?

> Male genotype = hh X^H Y, Female genotype = Hh X^H X^h, Male & female gametes are expanded, then the gametes are crossed in a punnett square.
