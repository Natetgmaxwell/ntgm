> When the ordinary thought of a highly cultivated people begins to regard 'having children' as a question of pro and con, the great turning-point has come. For Nature knows nothing of pro and con. Everywhere, wherever life is actual, reigns an inward organic logic, an 'it,' a drive, that is utterly independent of waking-being, with its causal linkages, and indeed not even observed by it. The abundant proliferation of primitive peoples is a natural phenomenon, which is not even thought about, still less judged as to its utility or reverse. When reasons have to be put forward at all in a question of life, life itself has become questionable. — Oswald Spengler

> Children experience life with a kind of magic and wonder that we as  adults can only catch the most fleeting glimpses of, and it’s a joy to  bring that perspective into your home and daily life.
