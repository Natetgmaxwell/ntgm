## Transcript

Hello and welcome to Learning Materials 7.2. Here we will look at biochemical disorders. In the early years of the 20th century Sir Archibald Garrett proposed that some human genetic disorders and abnormalities of metabolism are related. He studied a number of genetic disorders including alcaptonuria, cystinuria, and pentosuria. And he concluded that people with these disorders each carried a mutation that resulted in an enzyme defect that prevented them from carrying out a specific biochemical reaction. He called these kinds of disorders inborn errors of metabolism and from his work on families with these disorders, he concluded that those traits were inherited in a Mendelian inheritance pattern. His book Inborn Errors of Metabolism was a pioneering study in applying Mendelian genetics to humans and in understanding the relationships among genes, proteins, biochemical reactions and phenotypes. Mutations that eliminate or alter the activity of an enzyme can cause phenotypic effects in several ways. First, the substrate for the blocked reaction may build up and reach toxic levels, causing an abnormal phenotype. Second, the enzyme may control a reaction that produces a molecule needed for some cellular function. If this product is not made, a mutant phenotype may result. Mutations that affect enzymes can produce a wide range of phenotypes, ranging from inconsequential right through to lethal. Most metabolic disorders are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, so that only individuals that have two mutant alleles will be affected. Even though one mutant allele would produce a reduced or loss of function activity of the enzyme, it usually does not alter the health of a heterozygous carrier. And because many of the genes that encode disease-related enzymes have been identified and their mutations have been characterized, carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis are available for many of the metabolic disorders. This is a diagram from your textbook that shows the five different enzymes that can be affected in various inborn errors of the urea cycle. The urea cycle is a five-step metabolic pathway that takes place mainly in the liver cells for the removal of waste nitrogen from the amino groups of amino acids that arise from the normal turnover of protein. If a deficiency occurs in any of the enzymes within the urea cycle, this can result in an intolerance to protein from the accumulation of ammonia in the body. Increased ammonia levels are toxic to the central nervous system and can lead to coma and with some untreated urea cycle disorders, death, even in infancy in some severe cases. Biomolecules can be categorized into four primary groups. We have carbohydrates that are broken down into sugars. We have lipids that are broken down into fatty acids. We have proteins that are broken down into amino acids and we have nucleic acids that can be broken down into their individual nucleotides. We will look into how defects into the metabolic pathways that are associated with with amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and nucleic acid metabolism can cause disease in humans. In addition to these biomolecules, there are also external influences such as drugs, which are designed to be therapeutic, and also environmental toxins, which require enzymes to be able to break these external influences down. We'll also discuss some of the enzymes that are involved in these processes here as well. The Mendelian Inheritance in Man database was established in the early 1960s and it was designed to be a catalogue of disorders, of human disorders that display Mendelian inheritance patterns. And the way that it works is that every disease and gene is assigned a six digit number and The first number of the six digit number classifies the method of inheritance. So for example, the number one indicates that the disorder is autosomal dominant, the number two indicates that the disorder is autosomal recessive, and the number three indicates that the disorder is X-linked. So for example, if we look at a disorder like El Capstone urea, the MIM number is 203500. Because it begins with a 2, we know that El Capstone urea must be autosomal recessive. The database is now gone online, so it's now called Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, and you'll probably come across this when you're looking for information for your medical genetics assignment. The field of human biochemical genetics had its beginnings partly through the persistence of a young Norwegian mother. She had two children with intellectual disability, her daughter did not walk until she was nearly two years of age and could only speak a few words, and she had a musty odour that could not be washed away. Her son was also slow to develop and never learned to walk or talk. He had the same musty odour as his sister. The mother was convinced that whatever was causing the odour was also causing her children's intellectual disability. So the mother took her two children that were then aged four and seven to Dr. Firling, who It was a physician and a biochemist. Firling was able to purify the compound that was causing the musty odor and work out its chemical structure. The chemical in the children's urine was a compound called phenylpyruvic acid. Firling proposed that the phenylpyruvic acid in the urine was produced by a metabolic disorder that disrupted the breakdown of the amino acid phenylalanine. He also proposed that the accumulation of phenylpyruvic acid, which was the cause of the musty odor, in the bodies of the children was also the cause of their intellectual disability. He called this disorder phenylketoneuria, or PKU for short, and PKU is now regarded as a prototype for metabolic genetic disorders. Phenylketoneuria or PKU that was described by Firling is a disorder of amino acid metabolism. So there are 20 different amino acids and the human body can make 11 of these. So that means that nine amino acids must come from the diet and we call these essential amino acids. Phenylalanine is one of the essential amino acids And it's the starting point for a network of metabolic pathways. And that's summarized in this figure from your textbook here. So if the first step in this pathway is blocked by a mutation that prevents the conversion of phenylalanine, which is here, into another amino acid tyrosine, which is here, about 2/3 of the phenylalanine that we eat is converted into tyrosine by this reaction. The rest becomes incorporated into proteins. A mutation that prevents the conversion of phenylalanine into tyrosine results in PKU. In almost all cases, PKU is caused by a mutation in a gene for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or PAH, which is here in the pathway. And this normally converts phenylalanine into tyrosine. In people with PKU, phenylalanine from dietary proteins cannot be converted to tyrosine and builds up to high levels in the blood and tissues of the body. If untreated, newborns with high levels of phenylalanine develop severe intellectual disabilities, have reflexes that cause their arms and legs to move in a jerky fashion, have epileptic seizures and never acquire language skills. Also because the skin pigment melanin is a product of the blocked metabolic pathway, most people with PKU usually have lighter hair and skin colour than their siblings or other family members. PKU affects approximately 1 in 15,000 babies born in Australia and New Zealand and it was the first inborn era of metabolism that was routinely screened for in newborns. So the test is essentially a heel prick test which you can see here in the top corner where some blood is collected onto what we call a Guthrie card. So it's a cardboard sheet if you like that absorbs the blood and has preservatives there that will preserve the blood in a specific way for downstream testing. And this heel prick test is done between 48 and 72 hours after birth. The first sign of PKU in newborns is an abnormally high level of phenylalanine in the blood and in the urine. Infants with PKU develop normally before birth because the heterozygous mother has enough of the PAH enzyme in her body to break down the excess phenylalanine that accumulates in the fetus during prenatal development. After the child is born, this safeguard is no longer present and newborns who are homozygous for PKU develop neurological damage and become intellectually disabled when fed a normal diet. To avoid the consequences of PKU, a well-defined dietary treatment must be started in the first month after birth because after 30 days the brain is damaged beyond repair and treatment is less effective. By carefully managing the amount of phenylalanine in the diet, affected newborns who are diagnosed early have normal brain development and normal intelligence. However, managing PKU by controlling dietary intake is both difficult and expensive. One major problem is that phenylalanine is present in many protein sources such as meat, fish and cheese. And it's undesirable to eliminate all protein from the diet because phenylalanine is an essential amino acid and there must be enough phenylalanine in the body to make proteins for normal development of the nervous system. phenylalanine levels must be low enough to prevent intellectual disability. Dietary treatment of PKU uses a two-pronged approach. One is the restriction of protein intake and also the use of phenylalanine-free amino acid supplements. Carbohydrates are organic molecules that include simple sugars and more complex molecules, such as starches, glycogens and celluloses. These complex carbohydrates are polymers that are made up of long chains of sugar monomers. The simplest sugars called monosaccharides include fructose, glucose and galactose. And these are all important energy sources for the cell. Mutations that cause metabolic blocks in the synthesis and the breakdown of sugars and complex carbohydrates can produce a wide range of phenotypic effects that range from normal right through to fatal. Here we will examine two groups of disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, monosaccharide metabolism and glycogen storage. Galactosemia is an autosomal recessively inherited disorder caused by the inability to break down galactose, which is one of the two sugars that are found in lactose. Galactosemia is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase or GALT for short. When gold is missing or inactive, galactose metabolism is disrupted and a compound called galactose-1-phosphate accumulates and reaches toxic levels in the body. Newborns with galactosemia present with vomiting, lethargy, failure to thrive and jaundice in the second week of life. If untreated, they develop complications that include mental retardation, cataracts and liver cirrhosis. Severely affected infants die within a few months but mild cases may remain undiagnosed for many years. A galactose free diet and the use of galactose and lactose free foods lead to a reversal of symptoms. However, unless treatment is started within a few days after birth, intellectual disability cannot be prevented. are most commonly stored as glycogen in humans. Consequently, enzyme deficiencies that lead to impaired synthesis or degradation of glycogen are also considered disorders of carbohydrate metabolism. Glycogen is the form in which the sugar glucose is stored in the muscle and liver as a polymer acting as a reserve energy source. In the glycogen storage disorders, glycogen accumulates in excessive amounts in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, or also the liver, because of a variety of inborn errors of the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of glycogen. Additionally, because of the metabolic block, glycogen is unavailable as a normal glucose source. The two organs that are most severely affected by glycogen storage disorders are the liver and skeletal muscle. Glycogen storage disorders that affect the liver typically cause hepatomegaly, which is an enlarged liver, and hypoglycemia or low plasma glucose levels. Glycogen storage disorders that affect skeletal muscle cause exercise intolerance, progressive weakness and cramping. All in all there are around 30 different glycogen storage disorders. Disorders of lipid metabolism embraces a variety of disorders affecting cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoproteins and are important because of the consequences for cardiovascular disease. Elevated levels of plasma cholesterol have been associated with various conditions, especially low density lipoproteins or LDLs which are associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease. Lipids provide the backbone for phospholipids which are components of all biological membranes. Lipids such as cholesterol are also constituents of steroid hormones. They act as intracellular messengers and they serve as an energy substrate. During fasting and prolonged aerobic exercise, fatty acids are mobilised from adipose tissue and become a major substrate for energy production in the liver, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Elevated serum lipid levels or hyperlipidemia are common and result from defective lipid transport mechanisms. Disorders of lipid metabolism and transport present as either an acute illness that can be precipitated by an energy crisis or a chronic disorder such as coronary artery disease or stroke. The best known disorder of lipid metabolism is familial hypercholesteremia. This is associated with a significantly increased risk of early coronary artery disease and is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder. It's been estimated that about 1 in 500 people in the general population and about 1 in 20 that present with early coronary artery disease are heterozygous for a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene. And in the diagram, you can see here that individuals that are homozygous normal for the LDL receptor gene are able to bind that cholesterol, whereas individuals that are homozygous for the mutation are unable to bind that LDL to the membrane because of a defective receptor. Familial hypercholesterimia is the most common autosomal dominant single gene disorder in Western society. have raised cholesterol levels without symptoms but carry a significant risk of developing premature coronary artery disease leading to significant morbidity and increased mortality rates. They can present in childhood or in adolescence with subcutaneous deposition of lipid known as an exanthoma and you can see that here in this image. Cells normally derive cholesterol from either endogenous synthesis or from dietary uptake from LDL receptors on the cell surface. Intracellular cholesterol levels are maintained by a feedback system with free cholesterol inhibiting LDL receptor synthesis as well as reducing the level of de novo endogenous synthesis. cholesterol levels in familial hypercholesterolemia are due to deficient or defective function of the LDL receptors leading to increased levels of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. Four main classes of mutation in the LDL receptor have been identified. The first one is a reduced or a defective biosynthesis of the receptor and you can see that in this image out of your textbook here. The second one is a reduced or defective transport of the receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and that's indicated in the image over here. Abnormal binding of LDL by the receptor is the third one and so here we have this abnormal binding of the LDL receptor and the fourth one is abnormal internalization of the LDL by the receptor and that's indicated over here. In lysosomal storage disorders, disease results from the accumulation of a substrate. Enzymes within lysosomes catalyze the step-wise degradation of sphingolipids, mucopolysaccharides, glycoproteins and glycolipids. And here in this image you can see the lysosome with the enzymes inside. An accumulation or a storage of the undegraded molecules results in cell tissue and organ dysfunction. Most of the lysosomal disorders are caused by enzyme deficiencies. Many of the lysosomal storage disorders are found with uncommonly high prevalence in various ethnic populations as a result of founder effect and possibly natural selection. Children that are born with lysosomal storage diseases are usually normal initially but with the passage of time commence a downhill course of variable duration owing to this accumulation of one or more of a variety or type of macromolecules. Tay-Sachs disease is an example of a lipid storage disease that's known as sphingolipidosis. This is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder and it's thought that carriers of a single allele may have a selective advantage against tuberculosis infection which may explain its prevalence in certain ethnic groups. Essentially this disease is characterized by an inability to degrade sphingolipids and this is because there is an absence of the enzyme hexosaminidase A or hexa. The gene for this particular enzyme is located on chromosome 15. Here we see an accumulation of sphingolipids in the brain, the liver and the spleen. And infants usually present by about six months of age with poor feeding, lethargy and floppiness. The infant progressively deteriorates with deafness visual impairment and death occurs by about three years of age. The diagnosis of Tay-Sachs disease is supported clinically by the presence of a cherry red spot in the centre of the macula. And you can see that here in this image at the top. And biochemical confirmation of Tay-Sachs disease is a demonstration of reduced hexa levels in the serum. There is no effective treatment for this condition. Disorders of energy metabolism include a broad range of conditions that affect the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and also the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The small circular double-stranded mitochondrial DNA contains genes that code for some of the proteins that are involved in electron transport. So with mitochondrial respiratory chain disorders, we see a loss of coupling between oxidation and phosphorylation. The oxidative phosphorylation pathway is a biochemical process that's responsible for generating much of the ATP that's required for cellular energy. This process is mediated by five intra-mitochondrial enzyme complexes. Because most mitochondrial proteins, including the subunits involved in electron transport, are encoded by nuclear genes, these most often follow autosomal recessive inheritance. But sometimes we see autosomal dominant and X-linked forms. The disorders resulting from mutations in mitochondrial DNA are extremely variable owing to the phenomenon of heteroplasmy. The clinical features are mainly a combination of neurological signs, such as encephalopathy, dementia, ataxia, dystonia, neuropathy and seizures, and myopathic signs such as hypertonia, weakness and cardiomyopathy. Other symptoms and signs may include deafness, diabetes, retinal pigmentation and acidosis. Prenatal diagnosis and newborn screening become really important when we're dealing with biochemical disorders where there's an effective treatment that is able to modify the natural course of the disease. And here we can do biochemical analysis where we look for either an absence or an accumulation of a particular product, and we can also look at the DNA itself and look for mutations within genes that are known to be implicated in these particular disorders. So this can be really important in conditions such as PKU or galactosemia, because here, dietary intervention can prevent these serious neurological disorders that result from an absence of treatment. Here, genetic counseling could also be very important for the individuals that are affected by the disorder and also their family members.
