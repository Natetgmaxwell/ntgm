> Thyroid hormones boost animals' basal metabolic rate and represent an important thermoregulatory pathway for mammals that face cold temperatures. Whereas the cold thermal pressures experienced by primates in seasonal habitats at high latitudes and elevations are often apparent, tropical habitats also display distinct wet and dry seasons with modest changes in thermal environment. We assessed seasonal and temperature-related changes in thyroid hormone levels for two primate species in disparate thermal environments, tropical mantled howlers (Alouatta palliata), and seasonally cold-habitat Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). We collected urine and feces from animals and used ELISA to quantify levels of the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (fT3 ). For both species, fT3 levels were significantly higher during the cooler season (wet/winter), consistent with a thermoregulatory role. Likewise, both species displayed greater temperature deficits (i.e., the degree to which animals warm their body temperature relative to ambient) during the cooler season, indicating greater thermoregulatory pressures during this time. Independently of season, Japanese macaques displayed increasing fT3 levels with decreasing recently experienced maximum temperatures, but no relationship between fT3 and recently experienced minimum temperatures. Howlers increased fT3 levels as recently experienced minimum temperatures decreased, although demonstrated the opposite relationship with maximum temperatures. This may reflect natural thermal variation in howlers' habitat: wet seasons had cooler minimum and mean temperatures than the dry season, but similar maximum temperatures. Overall, our findings support the hypothesis that both tropical howlers and seasonally cold-habitat Japanese macaques utilize thyroid hormones as a mechanism to boost metabolism in response to thermoregulatory pressures. This implies that cool thermal pressures faced by tropical primates are sufficient to invoke an energetically costly and relatively longer-term thermoregulatory pathway. The well-established relationship between thyroid hormones and energetics suggests that the seasonal hormonal changes we observed could influence many commonly studied behaviors including food choice, range use, and activity patterns.

> Exposure to cold temperatures stimulates the production of thyroid hormone (Silva, 2003, 2006; Tomasi, 1991). Under experimental conditions, sudden drops in temperature can lead to rapid increases in T3. However the physiological effects, including mitochondrial activity and increased metabolism, take from 2 to 10 days to fully manifest (Goglia, Liverini, De Leo, & Barletta, 1983; Oppenheimer & Samuels, 1983; Roodyn, Freeman, & Tata, 1965; Silva, 2006; Tata et al., 1963).

> The relationship between thyroid hormones and metabolism also extends beyond temperature regulation. Since these hormones increase animals’ energetic requirements, elevated thyroid hormone levels are associated with increased caloric consumption (Pijl et al., 2001; Silva, 2003; Silvestri, Schiavo, Lombardi, & Goglia, 2005).

> Likewise, under caloric restriction animals decrease thyroid hormone levels as a strategy to lower BMR and conserve energy (Danforth & Burger, 1989; Eales, 1988; Fontana, Klein, Holloszy, & Premanchandra, 2006). Given that free-ranging animals can experience changes in food availability across a year, thyroid hormone levels may change in response to severe seasonal food shortages.

> For primates, a few seasonally breeding species show increases in thyroid hormone levels during or prior to the mating season, particularly for males (Cristóbal-Azkarate, Maréchal, Semple, Majolo, & MacLarnon, 2016; Kaack, Walker, & Walker, 1980; Petter-Rousseaux, 1984). This is consistent with the role thyroid hormones play in mammalian spermatogenesis (Wagner, Wajner, & Maia, 2009).
