The structure of skeletal muscle fibers and the sliding filament mechanism of muscle contraction were discussed in the most recent video. The myofibril, which is composed of overlapping thick and thin myofilaments, makes up a skeletal muscle fiber. Each myofibril has a sarcomere at its center, where the thick filament (myosin) and the thin filament (actin) overlap. The myosin heads form cross bridges with the actin subunits, causing the sarcomere to shorten and contract when calcium ions bind to troponin.
