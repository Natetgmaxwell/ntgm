## Transcript

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,800
Hello LFS112. My name is Dr. Georgia Kefir and I am going to deliver your

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,960
first recorded learning materials for topic 1 where we will cover core

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,040
principles, the integrometry system and also thermoregulation. Now you're

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:23,840
probably wondering why I started this very serious human physiology module

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,520
with a comic and there's two reasons. The first is that this is an awkward yeti

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:38,800
comic and they produce these really nice funny physiology based cartoons that as you're

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,320
budding physiologist you should find quite funny.

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:50,560
But also for Reason B, this image shows all of the different systems that you over the

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,920
course of this semester are going to learn about and are going to learn about how they

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,400
work with each other, sometimes against each other, to essentially achieve a healthy physiological

11
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,400
state.

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,280
Today we're going to cover core principles.

13
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,800
In this first module we're going to cover core principles and these are aspects of physiology

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:23,800
that you're going to need to know to be able to fully understand other topics as you move

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,600
through the course.

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,400
In saying that, this is the parts of our first topic.

17
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,300
So you can see topic 1.1, which is what this recorded learning material consists of, is

18
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,000
core principles.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,780
Then we will look in subsequent parts, which are all separate videos, at the intergrammetry

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,560
system, which is just a fancy word for skin, the accessory components for that system in

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,880
topic 1.3 and then in topic 1.4 we will look at body temperature and

22
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,240
thermoregulation. Now all of the readings for this course can be found in

23
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
this textbook. This is a new version of this textbook. It's the Martini text and

24
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,440
for each topic we will have a list of the specific places where you can find

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,160
those readings in the bottom of the screen. And so you can see here that for

26
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,160
this topic chapter 1, 4, 5 and 25 contain your readings.

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:33,040
Okay, so the last little bit of housekeeping I want to talk about is these learning objectives.

28
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,360
So at the start of each topic, just like this, we will present to you the learning objectives

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:49,180
that we hope or we want you to be competent in to essentially be completely all over the

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:55,380
course material and to pass the course knowing all the things that we want to

31
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:59,380
need to know. So you should base your study around these because this is as I

32
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,340
said this is what we've decided is the important parts of the course and for my

33
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,060
modules I'm going to actually point out at the start of each module which

34
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,100
learning objectives we are going to cover in that particular part. So for

35
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:19,740
example today we are going to be looking at core principles but specifically we

36
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,420
are going to be looking at homeostatic mechanisms. The other parts of the other

37
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:32,500
learning objectives we will cover in a different topic as we move through.

38
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:40,260
Okay so let's get into it. Let's think about what physiology is. So it's a very

39
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,340
broad term. It pretty much describes the science of life and it describes the

40
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:53,540
science of life all the way down from your atoms up to your ecosystem level.

41
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:02,020
In Physiology 112 we are going to touch upon molecules, we're going to maybe

42
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,380
touch upon genes, but we're going to be specifically focused with looking at

43
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,580
this part of physiology. So how organelles, cells, tissues, organs and organ systems all

44
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:22,020
work together to make sure that the organism stays healthy and happy.

45
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:28,340
This is only one part of physiology. There is many, many other parts which you will probably

46
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:35,300
come across through university studies. For example, pathophysiology, understanding how

47
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,460
disease starts and progresses. But what you really need to be thinking about for

48
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:47,540
this course is that you should be coming familiar with how different parts of

49
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:51,520
your body work together and that is in essence the physiology that we're

50
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,980
studying. So today in particular we're going to look at the core principles of

51
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:04,420
physiology and the most core principle is homeostasis. So some of you might have

52
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,180
heard this word before, or heard of this word before, it exists, it essentially

53
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:16,980
refers to the existence of a stable internal environment. Okay? The word

54
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:22,060
homeostasis can be broken down into three parts. Homeo, which means similar,

55
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:31,540
Stacey, which means stable, and cis, which means process. Homeostasis is critical

56
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,180
for our health. And so it's absolutely essential that our body tries to maintain a homeostatic

57
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,100
environment. And some of the processes or some of the mechanisms in our body that depend

58
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:52,100
on homeostasis include temperature control, blood glucose, blood pressure, and also our

59
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,300
ability to carry oxygen in our blood, the levels of water and electrolytes in our body,

60
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,460
as well as our bodies pH.

61
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,220
Now, the way that we achieve homeostasis

62
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,740
is very, very, very complicated.

63
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,820
But there are two main body systems

64
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,660
that essentially let us have this homeostatic environment.

65
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,700
And so these are the endocrine system and the nervous system.

66
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
The endocrine system,

67
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,540
which you're going to learn more about in week four,

68
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:33,180
essentially directs a long-term regulation or adjustment of organ systems, whereas the

69
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:39,140
nervous system, which you will learn about more in week two, directs more short-term,

70
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,580
rapid and very specific responses.

71
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,500
That probably doesn't mean so much to you right now, but as you move through the semester,

72
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:53,820
you will definitely appreciate how the endocrine and the nervous system work together to achieve

73
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,820
homeostasis.

74
00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:10,320
So let's actually have a think about, you know, we've got these two systems that we know maintain homeostasis, but how did they do that?

75
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,320
Okay. So the first thing that I want you to think about is that homeostasis does not mean static.

76
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:23,760
Okay? What it actually means is that there are small fluctuations which keep our systems working

77
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:31,920
within a healthy environment and we refer to these as sort of physiological tolerance limits.

78
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,440
Okay, so if we looked at this just how quickly it is sort of image over here,

79
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:45,600
homeostasis is that small fluctuations. So there is a healthy range and our body fluctuates a

80
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:53,120
little bit but stays within these healthy ranges. If our body can't stay within these

81
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,040
healthy ranges then diseases can happen which is what you can see here of the upper and

82
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,380
the lower limits of the physiological tolerances. An example of this would be for example body

83
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:12,960
temperature. So if your body's temperature rises too much then the proteins which are

84
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,680
inside your body can essentially undergo something called denaturation where they

85
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,880
become a funny shape and when they these proteins denature it means that they

86
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,000
can't do their jobs properly and so if your proteins in a particular organ say

87
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,160
your liver can't do their jobs properly because they're too hot and they've

88
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,640
denatured then your liver might start to fail and then obviously that will

89
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,600
compromise your health. So there are three main parts of homeostatic control

90
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:48,160
and that can be seen on this image here. So the first part is the receptor. So our

91
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,440
receptor is essentially capable of sensing a stimulus and then what it does

92
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,840
is it communicates that to the second major part which is the control center.

93
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,600
The control center receives and essentially processes the information

94
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,400
that it's got from the receptor and then it sends a signal to the effector and

95
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:16,400
and the effector essentially responds to the original receptor signals

96
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:25,400
and will induce an effect that might either oppose or enhance the stimulus that the receptor initially received.

97
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Okay?

98
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:35,400
So, the way that the body does this is that it uses a few strategies that it has up its sleeve.

99
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:44,920
These include [[Cards/Feedback Loops\|feedback loops]], structure-function relationships, biological gradients and cellular

100
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
communication.

101
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,200
And we are going to talk about each one of these right now and I'm going to go through

102
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,920
some examples of each one.

103
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,080
Now as you go through the course, what's going to happen is you're going to learn about these

104
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,080
different systems and you're going to learn more specific examples of these

105
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,400
four mechanisms that homeostasis is achieved through. But in this module like

106
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,640
I said I'm just going to give you a little bit of an overview and so we are

107
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,920
going to start with [[Cards/Feedback Loops\|feedback loops]]. One of the simplest ways to describe feedback

108
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,560
loops is to think about household air conditioning because that is essentially

109
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,920
an example of household homeostasis. So if your house has air conditioning it

110
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,980
will probably have a thermostat and you set that thermostat to the temperature

111
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,160
that you like. So in this case 22 degrees. This is essentially the control center.

112
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:51,600
Now what happens is that the receptor in the system which is the thermometer keeps

113
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,760
it keeps its feel as open and and and senses essentially the temperature. If

114
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:00,520
If the temperature rises above 22 degrees,

115
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,840
then it's going to tell by sending a stimulus

116
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,080
or sending information to the control center.

117
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,520
The control center gets the information

118
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,280
and decides, yep, you're right, it is above 22 degrees.

119
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,120
And so it then sends a command to the effector.

120
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
In this case, it's the air conditioner.

121
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,520
The air conditioner will be turned on,

122
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,560
the temperature should come down,

123
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,920
And then we have a nice simple feedback mechanism

124
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,000
where a stimulus communicated to the control center

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,080
to induce a response.

126
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,920
Simple as that.

127
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,860
This is a very simple feedback loop

128
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,660
and there are other feedback mechanisms

129
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,940
or other versions of feedback mechanisms

130
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,420
that we need to think about when we think about physiology.

131
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,200
So one of those is a [[Cards/Negative Feedback Loops\|negative feedback]] loop,

132
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
which is actually what that temperature example represents,

133
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,920
and the other is a positive feedback loop.

134
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
So let's first just elaborate a little bit more

135
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,520
on the [[Cards/Negative Feedback Loops\|negative feedback]] loop.

136
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,280
So in a [[Cards/Negative Feedback Loops\|negative feedback]] loop,

137
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,360
what we are looking at is an initial stimulus,

138
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,240
which when it communicates to the control center,

139
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,680
will cause a change in the completely opposite direction.

140
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,460
So the air conditioning was a good example

141
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,580
because the stimulus was that it was too hot.

142
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,700
So then the air conditioning works

143
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,740
to make the temperature colder.

144
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,340
Has the opposite effect.

145
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,420
We talked about air conditioning,

146
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,060
but the body's version of air conditioning

147
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,300
is actually thermoregulation.

148
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,860
And this is exactly what's happening in our bodies

149
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:49,460
when we are too hot or too cold.

150
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,720
There is a [[Cards/Negative Feedback Loops\|negative feedback]] mechanism.

151
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,080
And in this case, obviously our control center is the brain.

152
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,760
It's not a thermostat.

153
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,640
And the brain receives signals from body sensors,

154
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,400
and there are many of them, which we will talk about later

155
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,160
in this topic, which then sends the commands

156
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,480
to the effectors, which can either increase or decrease

157
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,400
the body temperature, depending on whether you were hot or cold.

158
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:19,640
As an aside here, I also just wanted

159
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:29,240
to point out that I have this figure down the bottom labeled as figure 1.9 page 67.

160
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,120
And as we move through these learning materials, you will find that whenever we use images

161
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:40,680
from this textbook, that we will have them, we will point out specifically where we got

162
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,680
them from, just like that, to help you with your revision.

163
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:52,800
Okay, so we've covered [[Cards/Negative Feedback Loops\|negative feedback loops]], so now let's have a look at positive feedback

164
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
loops.

165
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:00,080
So positive feedback concerns a mechanism where a change in a given direction will cause

166
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,480
a further change in the same direction.

167
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,880
Sounds a bit confusing, right?

168
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,120
Okay, so let's think about an example just to show you how this works.

169
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,480
And so one of the best examples that we have is blood clotting.

170
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,800
So in this scenario, which you can see here,

171
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,440
a blood vessel appears to have some damage in its cell wall.

172
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,600
The area will begin to release these chemicals

173
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,080
to essentially tell the body, hey, there's damage here.

174
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,360
Can you please come and fix it?

175
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,480
And that fixing is a clotting mechanism.

176
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,120
What happens is that you start to get chemicals.

177
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,760
You start to get some cell fragments,

178
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:48,720
different cells, proteins that come and essentially start to form the clot. The

179
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,400
more chemicals, the more proteins that come along, release more chemicals and

180
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:00,380
more protein. And so what happens is that the more clotting that happens, the more

181
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:06,720
signal is sent, the more clotting that happens. So you have this positive

182
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,880
feedback loop where a recruitment continues and continues and continues

183
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,560
until this blood clot has been formed. Once it's been formed the blood doesn't

184
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,680
need, sorry the vessel doesn't need any more help and so that signal will

185
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,960
start to drop off which will then also start to drop off in the recruitment of

186
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,800
your chemicals and your cells and your blood clotting factors. And so here your

187
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,600
positive feedback is that more clodding causes more clodding. So that brings us

188
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,700
to the end of talking about these two types of [[Cards/Feedback Loops\|feedback loops]]. There are many,

189
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,240
many more examples of this and like I said as you move through the course

190
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:57,880
you're going to find out what these are. As you are moving through the

191
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,480
course and you are learning about new [[Cards/Feedback Loops\|feedback loops]] I want you to stop and

192
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,840
about whether these loops are positive or negative. Okay, try and do that as you move along.

193
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:14,440
Alright, so we've done [[Cards/Feedback Loops\|feedback loops]], so now we're going to have a look at structure function

194
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:24,600
relationships. Okay, so this is probably my favorite example of a structure function relationship.

195
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,320
But first let's just explain a little bit about what I'm talking about. So evolution has a sense

196
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:38,140
essentially allowed our bodies to come up with really unique novel structures that help

197
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,460
our organs and our cells to achieve their function better, or at least in the easiest

198
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460
way possible.

199
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:49,720
And a perfect example is the capillary structure.

200
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,180
So this capillary, which you can see here, actually has individual blood cells running

201
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,460
through it.

202
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:04,220
And what you will note is that the walls of the capillary, so this is the capillary outline

203
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:10,940
just here, and the blood cells are running in here and also running in here.

204
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,220
And what you will notice is that the walls of the capillary are not much thicker than

205
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,740
the fabulous blood cell.

206
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,380
They're also super thin, which is why using a light marker scraper you can see straight

207
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,540
through it.

208
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:33,180
Now this very, very thin wall structure and small capillary size essentially allows the

209
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,260
cells within the capillary, in this case the blood cells, to achieve a very fast and efficient

210
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,640
exchange with their surrounding environments.

211
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,020
Now where that structure comes in, very importantly, is in the lungs.

212
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:55,780
So here if we look at the lung structure, which you will cover more extensively, I think

213
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:00,380
in week 10 in your respiration topics.

214
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:06,060
But just right now what I want you to appreciate is that when you breathe in air, the air comes

215
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:11,140
into your lungs and it must somehow deliver oxygen to the blood.

216
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,580
The way that it does this is through capillaries.

217
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:22,180
And so you can see here that this is the area where the gases are and this is the area where

218
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,980
the blood is.

219
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:28,540
And this structure, if I use a slightly different colour to make it a little bit easier for

220
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,580
you, this structure here is the capillary.

221
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:40,100
Now because the capillary walls are really thin, it means that there is really easy diffusion

222
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,500
of gases across that wall.

223
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,340
And so the structure of the capillary helps the lung to achieve its function.

224
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:56,260
If the capillary walls were too thick, like in this example over here, then the gases,

225
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:03,900
so your oxygen and carbon dioxide, would have a much harder time reaching the blood or coming

226
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,740
out of the blood.

227
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:13,620
And so the function of the lung will be compromised by this inefficient structure.

228
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:18,260
And so what I want you to think about here is that the function of the lungs is enhanced

229
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:22,760
by the structures within it.

230
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:28,140
So that was the structure-function relationship and now what we're going to do is have a look

231
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,360
at biological gradients.

232
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,800
So a gradient essentially just describes a situation where you have increasing or decreasing

233
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,780
concentrations of any given matter.

234
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,200
So in this image that I put together here, the matter is essentially blue spots.

235
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,680
So it's very simple.

236
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:54,180
In the top panel, so up here, you can see that there is a different amount of blue spots

237
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,240
on either side of the panel.

238
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,680
So this side has a very low amount of blue spots and this side has a high amount of blue

239
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,440
spots.

240
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,640
And so this is what we call a gradient, where the right hand side has a higher concentration

241
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,840
of blue spots.

242
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,840
The bottom panel in comparison does not have any gradient because there's the same concentration

243
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,400
of blue spots across the entire panel.

244
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,520
Now, even though this seems really simple,

245
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,520
gradients drive many very complicated physiologic processes.

246
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,360
So one example like what we just talked about

247
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,360
with the lungs is oxygen.

248
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,360
And so we have these different gradients in our lungs

249
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,080
where the air that comes in will have

250
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,840
a higher oxygen concentration than what is in the blood.

251
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,960
And so that means that that oxygen

252
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,680
in a high concentration environment, it wants to move to a concentration environment that

253
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:05,320
is lower. And so this is why your blood actually receives the oxygen because it's coming out

254
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:12,040
of the air in your lungs because the blood will have a lower concentration of oxygen.

255
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,200
There are some other systems where these gradients are also really important. So for example,

256
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:25,200
the skin. We have a high internal environment typically compared to our outer environment.

257
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:32,640
And so when heat comes to the surface of the skin, it will be lost into the colder environment

258
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,280
because of that temperature gradient. Another gradient that's really important is in the

259
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,520
gut where you have water moving through your gut as well as food. And the water will move

260
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,320
from the gut's lumen, so the inside of the gut,

261
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,600
into the cells that surround the lumens,

262
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,020
or into the epithelium,

263
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,240
because those cells have a lower concentration of water.

264
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,080
And so that process is called [[Cards/Osmosis\|osmosis]],

265
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,320
and you've probably covered that

266
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,260
in an earlier first-year course.

267
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,320
So that was biological gradients.

268
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,920
The last thing that we're going to talk about

269
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,580
in this module is [[Cards/Cell Signalling\|cellular communication]].

270
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
So I think you'll all be familiar with the fact

271
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,600
that cells don't just sit in their own little isolated spots

272
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,280
and do their own thing and never talk to any other cell.

273
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,200
They actually have to communicate with other cells.

274
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,120
They have to do that to live, to grow, to be useful.

275
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,980
And it's important to know that through this communication,

276
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,880
they can influence other cells

277
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,240
and other cells can influence them.

278
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,320
And this is really critical for homeostatic control

279
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,020
because we need that effector system

280
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,360
and the receptor system to communicate

281
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,760
to the central control center, i.e. your brain.

282
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,920
So there's four different types of [[Cards/Cell Signalling\|cellular communication]].

283
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,440
There is direct, which occurs

284
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,040
when cells are sitting right next to each other.

285
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,440
There is paracrine, which occurs between cells

286
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
that exist in a similar area,

287
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,400
but they might not be right next to each other.

288
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:14,960
There's also endocrine, which is more long-range communication.

289
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,520
So some cells in your hypothalamus, for example,

290
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,600
might be able to communicate to the cells

291
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,000
in your parts of your gut, which is quite a big distance,

292
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,720
really, if you are the size of a cell.

293
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,200
And the last one is synaptic.

294
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,200
And so this is a neural communication, which

295
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,040
involves, essentially, electricity.

296
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,520
So we'll just have a quick look at some of the specific

297
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,120
features of these communication types.

298
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,960
So for direct communication, this usually occurs

299
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,600
via specific little channels called [[Cards/Gap Junctions\|gap junctions]].

300
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,520
And the mediators of this include ions, solutes,

301
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,360
lipid soluble materials.

302
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,640
And like I said, this specifically works

303
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,860
with neighbor cells.

304
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,680
We also have paracrine communication,

305
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,960
which is also in a local area,

306
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,880
not just in the neighbor cells.

307
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,200
The mediators of these are paracrine factors,

308
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,400
which is a whole range of them.

309
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,840
Knowing those is a little bit beyond the context

310
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,080
of the course.

311
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,520
You probably will come across some specific examples

312
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,160
in some sections,

313
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,920
but just know that they are called paracrine factors.

314
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,980
And this happens via the extracellular fluid.

315
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,240
So the cells will usually secrete something

316
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,160
which then travels a little way and then acts on another cell.

317
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,920
Endocrine, on the other hand, is whole body.

318
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,840
So that's one organ talking to another organ.

319
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,520
This happens by hormones, and these are really, really important for physiology.

320
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,200
You can think of them as chemical messenger systems.

321
00:24:52,200 --> 00:25:00,360
Hormones travel always via the bloodstream, and that is how cells in your brain, for example,

322
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:05,600
communicate with cells with some or the endocrine cells specifically in your

323
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,440
brain so say in your posterior pituitary or anterior pituitary can for example if

324
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:16,400
I am a lactating pregnant woman can tell my breasts to make milk which um it

325
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,720
seems pretty weird that that communication is happening that way but

326
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,640
that's happening by an endocrine response. The last one is synaptic and

327
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:33,640
And this is by synapses, which are specific cell types that we know as [[Cards/Nerves\|nerves]] or neurons.

328
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,640
It happens via neurotransmitters, and this is a cell-to-receptor sort of an effect.

329
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,640
Okay, so that brings us to the end of Topic 1.1. I hope you had fun.

330
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,640
We have looked at [[Cards/Feedback Loops\|feedback loops]], and we have looked at both positive and negative regulation.

331
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:02,680
We've also looked at how structure can facilitate the function of different organs and let them

332
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,000
achieve homeostasis.

333
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,680
We've looked at biological gradients and how these are the driving factors for some physiological

334
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,360
processes.

335
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,560
And we've looked at [[Cards/Cell Signalling\|cellular communication]] and seen how different signals can be coordinated

336
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,320
to essentially achieve function.

337
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:25,120
So like I said, this brings us to the end of topic 1.1.

338
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,760
I hope that you have enjoyed it and that you are ready for the next part, which is topic

339
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,720
1.2, where we're going to look at the [[Cards/Integumentary System\|integumentary system]], which is, like I said, just a fancy

340
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,720
name for the skin.

341
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:36,720
Thanks.

342
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,840
Thanks!

343
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,500
(air whooshing)
