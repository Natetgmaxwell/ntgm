> Chemists have taken these natural products and produced structural analogues to give:  o Higher Potency  ▪ Drug produces its desired effects at lower concentrations  o Greater Efficacy  ▪ Drug directs a greater amplitude in its effects  o Reduced Side-Effects  ▪ Removal of the unwanted side-effects which can limit the usefulness of a drug

> Aspirin irreversibly acetylates and inhibits the activity of both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzymes. These enzymes are responsible for converting arachidonic acid into prostaglandin H2, which is a precursor for various prostaglandins and thromboxanes.
