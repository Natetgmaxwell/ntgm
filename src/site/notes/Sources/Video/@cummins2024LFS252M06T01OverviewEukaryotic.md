> Gene expression control in eukaryotic organisms allows for the proper genes being
> expressed in the proper cells at the proper times during embryologic development
> and cellular differentiation
> 
> Transcriptional control is the primary means of regulating gene expression in
> eukaryotes, as it is in bacteria
> In eukaryotic genomes, DNA transcription-control elements may be located many
> kilobases away from the promoter they regulate.
> Eukaryotes contain three types of nuclear RNA polymerases. All three contain two
> large and three smaller core subunits with homology to subunits of E. coli RNA
> polymerase, as well as several additional small subunits
