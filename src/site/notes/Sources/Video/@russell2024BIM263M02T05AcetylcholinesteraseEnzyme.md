## Transcript

This is module 2, section 5, Acetylcholine esterase enzyme kinetics. In the previous section I talked about the metabolism of acetylcholine and there we saw that the enzyme acetylcholinesterase is instrumental in the breakdown of acetylcholine to what is by and large biologically inactive metabolites, plus choline plus acetate. Now it's important to understand the kinetics for this reaction in order to understand the pharmacology of enzyme inhibitors. In the previous section we also talked a little bit about some of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, drugs such as phisostigmine and also some of the organophosphate compounds. We can examine the kinetics for acetylcholinesterase by plotting the initial velocity of reaction V0 against substrate concentration. The square brackets that you see on the x-axis around the capital letter S is referring to the fact that we're talking about a concentration. As we increase the substrate concentration, so in this case the substrate would be acetylcholine, have an increase in the velocity of reaction. But eventually this hyperbolic curve plateaus and this is because there are only a finite number of catalytic sites. So if we hold the amount of acetylcholinesterase enzyme constant but increase the amount of substrate, eventually those catalytic sites will become saturated with substrate and that gives us a maximal velocity of reaction. This is as hard as the reaction can work with the amount of enzyme that is present and we refer to this level as the Vmax. So the Vmax is the maximal velocity of reaction and it is asymptotic. This curve is approaching but does not reach the Vmax. The Km that you see here is referring to the Macales-Menten constant, and this is equal to the substrate concentration at half maximal velocity of reaction. So if I throw out a number here, let's say Vmax was 100, then half of that is going to be 50, And we read across to the curve down to the x-axis, and that gives us the km. So what is the value of the Michaelis-Menten constant? Well, the Michaelis-Menten constant, km, tells us about the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. The lower the number of the km, the higher is the affinity. And conversely, the higher the km, the larger the number of the km, the lower is the affinity. The Michaelis-Menten equation relates the initial velocity of reaction V naught to the maximal velocity of reaction V max, the substrate concentration, as well as the Michaelis-Menten constant. OK, so there are different types of inhibitors. There are reversible competitive inhibitors. There are irreversible inhibitors and also non-competitive inhibitors. Let's have a look at the competitive reversible inhibitor first. This is illustrated here. So we've got a substrate molecule that could interact with the catalytic site. And if it does this, it would be converted to the product. However, if the inhibitor molecule interacts with the catalytic site, then there would be no further catalysis. The substrate would not be able to be converted to the product because the inhibitor is preventing this. Now for competitive reversible inhibition, what is really important here is that the inhibitor will dissociate from the catalytic site. So that is to say that it will come away from the catalytic site and make it available for substrate to interact. In the absence of any inhibitor molecule, the substrate will interact with the catalytic site and the enzyme will convert that substrate to product. So if this green wedge here was acetylcholine, the product would be choline plus acetate. Now that's in the absence of any inhibitor. If we were to add in an inhibitor into the mix, then we can prevent the metabolism of acetylcholine to those degradation products. So through occupancy of the catalytic site, inhibitor is preventing the conversion of the substrate to the product. We can gauge the kinetics for this reaction by plotting the initial velocity of reaction against substrate concentration and this is illustrated at the bottom left here. The green line represents the reaction in the absence of any inhibitor. So as we increase substrate concentration we get a very steep increase in initial velocity of reaction. However, when we throw in an inhibitor into the mix, then this tends to dampen down the capacity of the enzyme to be able to convert the substrate to product. So this is illustrated here with the red line. You can see that this line is less steep compared to when there is no inhibitor present. If we hold the concentration of inhibitor constant, but increase the concentration of substrate then something interesting happens. Have a look at the diagram on the left hand side here. Again we're plotting initial velocity of reaction against substrate concentration and we have hyperbolic curves. The green line is the reaction in the absence of inhibitor and the red line is a reaction in the presence of inhibitor. As we increase the substrate concentration, the substrate starts to out-compete the inhibitor for binding to the catalytic site. This is represented over here. So the probability of one of these green wedges interacting with the catalytic site is vastly greater than the probability that one of these red inhibitor molecules is going to interact with the catalytic site. We can, by increasing the substrate concentration but keeping the amount of inhibitor constant, recapitulate the maximal velocity of reaction or at least get very close to the Vmax. We would say here that we have some mountable inhibition. We've been able to overcome the inhibitor simply by increasing the amount of substrate. Okay, have a look at the diagram again. What do you think's happened to the KM and what do you things happened to the Vmax. We'll talk a little bit more about this in the tutorial. Because the Vmax is asymptotic it is a little bit difficult sometimes to determine a precise value for the maximal velocity of reaction and because we're determining the Km based on the Vmax it's also quite difficult to get an accurate assessment of the Michaelis-Menten constant. Now to overcome this problem we can take the reciprocal of the initial velocity of reaction and plot this against the reciprocal of the substrate concentration and that will give us what is referred to as the Lineweaver-Burk plot or sometimes simply referred to as a double reciprocal plot. So we've plotted 1 over V naught against 1 over substrate concentration. The intercept with the y-axis is 1 over V max. So from this value, from this intercept, we can easily calculate the maximal velocity of reaction. The intercept with the x-axis is equal to negative 1 over the Michaelis-Menten constant, Km. And again, it's pretty easy to calculate the Km value. What you'll notice here is that there is no change in Vmax with a competitive reversible inhibitor. And we saw this with the hyperbolic curve a moment ago. But we We also notice here that there is an increase in the KN value when we add a competitive reversible inhibitor. Let me introduce you to the eastern green mamba. This is a snake that contains within its venom, fasciculant 2. Fasciculant 2 is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It interacts with specific sites within the catalytic site of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme referred to as the peripheral site. The bite of the mamba is potentially fatal and part of the reason for that is the presence of fasciculant 2. This is a plot of the normalized acetylcholinesterase activity on the y-axis against the concentration of fasciculant 2 on the x-axis. Now what we can see here with this curve is that at low concentrations of fasciculant 2 there is no appreciable inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme and so we have what is a hundred percent enzyme activity but as we increase the concentration of fasciculant 2 you can see that enzyme activity starts to decrease and at very high levels of fasciculant 2 we can completely inhibit the ability of acetylcholinesterase to metabolize acetylcholine to choline plus acetate. Okay, so those are the competitive reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Irreversible inhibitors are inhibitors that will bind to the catalytic site, but they won't dissociate, so they will just stay there. So if you have enough irreversible inhibitor present, you can block all of the available catalytic sites. And if that is the case, there is no chance that any of the substrate molecules will ever interact with the catalytic site. The enzyme will be permanently blocked. There will be no catalysis, even if we increase substrate concentration to extremely high levels. Now this is a comparison of the competitive reversible inhibition shown on the left versus irreversible enzyme inhibition shown on the right hand side. As we saw a moment ago with competitive reversible inhibition, the inhibition is surmountable. If we increase the substrate concentration, we can re-establish maximal velocity of reaction or at least get very close to the Vmax. But we also observed an increase in the KM indicating a decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. For irreversible enzyme inhibition, we have got no change in Km, but we have a decrease in the maximum velocity of reaction. So this is not surmountable. Even if we go to very high concentrations of substrate, there's no way to overcome the inhibition that is caused by an irreversible inhibitor. And finally, if we construct the line weaver-Burk plot, so linearizing the data by plotting the reciprocal of the velocity of reaction against the reciprocal of the substrate concentration, then we can see that the intercepts with the y-axis are different in the absence and presence inhibitor. However, the two lines converge at the same point on the x-axis indicating no change in KM. So we have a decrease in the maximal velocity of reaction but no change in KM with the irreversible inhibitor.
