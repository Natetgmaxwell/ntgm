## Transcript

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
In this video we're going to take a look at the genetic analysis of mutations.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,400
This is a nice finish up to the research or the work that we've done on both

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,160
transcription and translation. So those videos or that information gives you the

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:20,800
basic idea about how proteins are made. But another question you might like to

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,920
ask is how do we actually know what the function of a protein is? There's several

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:32,760
different ways that we can do that. One of those ways is actually making mutants of the

7
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:39,480
genes that encode the proteins. So mutants that we can make are actually ones that completely

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,720
inactivate or turn off the expression of a gene, that is that protein is not going to be made at

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:53,080
all. Another thing that we can do is actually modify the expression of the proteins that only

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,680
turned on under certain environmental conditions.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,160
And these kind of mutations are called conditional mutants.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,120
So just to reiterate, that's a mutation that

13
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,880
can turn protein expression on or off.

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,160
We can use the terms protein expression here

15
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:15,000
interchangeably with a specific observable phenotype.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,320
So some ways that we can turn genes on or off

17
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,960
is by growing them on different growth

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:24,960
that have certain chemicals, but often what is used is temperature.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,960
So we can use a specific promoter that's only functional at certain temperatures.

20
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Say for instance it works at 40 degrees, but it's not functional at 37 degrees.

21
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:44,960
So in that case, a particular organism that's growing at 37 won't express a specific protein we're interested in.

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,320
And if you shift the growth temperature to 40 degrees, it will turn on expression of

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,240
a particular protein and we can see how that changes the phenotype of an organism.

24
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,540
Conditional mutants are often made in what's called haploid organisms.

25
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,720
So a haploid organism is simply an organism with a single set of chromosomes.

26
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,800
That means, because we've got one set of chromosomes, we only need to make a mutation in one

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,760
gene. Compare that to a diploid organism. It's a diploid one, so it has two sets of chromosomes.

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,800
That means we basically have to make mutations in both alleles. We're going to talk a little bit

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,160
more about that on the next slide. So a nice example here is yeast. Yeast is a haploid organism.

30
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,120
In this case, this yeast has a mutant in the gene CDC7.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,360
And this particular mutation is involved

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,360
in helping the yeast move to the next cycle of division.

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,760
CDC stands for cell division cycle.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,800
We can through biotechnological means

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
make conditional mutants in that particular gene.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,980
And we can then look for specific phenotypes.

37
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,840
So on the left here now, or in the middle,

38
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,680
these are our wild type strains.

39
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
So these are the guys that are actually expressing

40
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,460
the Cdc7 protein.

41
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:23,480
What's happening there is yeast is growing.

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,800
We can see some different size yeast cells and budding.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,460
And so we have, in some instances, large yeasts,

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,840
cells mixed to small ones.

45
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,500
Here it is here.

46
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:45,100
However, when we have the mutant and we make that mutation, we no longer see the body happening

47
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,100
in an effective mechanism.

48
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,980
So look at the phenotype over here.

49
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,980
All these yeast cells, as they're preparing to bind and divide, are actually all the same

50
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
size.

51
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:05,480
So by making a mutation in Cdc7, we've arrested the development of those

52
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,480
particular yeast cells that they can't grow and divide anymore.

53
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Why do we want to use this conditional mutant, not just make a simple

54
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,480
mutation where this Cdc7 has turned off all the time?

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Well, if it was turned off all the time, we could never actually ever grow these

56
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,480
yeast cells because they're never going to grow normally.

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:30,080
So we grow them under standard conditions where this

58
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,440
mutation is, where this conditional mutation is not

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,680
turned on and that means that we can grow lots of yeast cells

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,920
then we shift the temperature so that we now have the muted

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,400
activity turned on and that means and that we can sort of look

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
and analyze what happens when this particular defect

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,320
is present.

64
00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:00,240
We're going to finish with the concept of recessive lethal mutations in diploids.

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:09,200
So these are mutations that if they're present in a homozygous offspring, result in lethality.

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,520
So you can carry a recessive lethal allele in a heterozygous organism,

67
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,520
as shown at the top here, but you do not see that in this particular organism because it's

68
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,920
the recessive allele. It's the dominant allele which is being expressed and if

69
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:33,580
responsible for the phenotype that you see. But if you actually cross heterozygous

70
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,680
organisms with each other, one of the offspring at 25% of the time is going to

71
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,640
be homozygous for the two small bees or the two recessive alleles. In this case,

72
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,720
this mutant organism here would actually be lethal. So in the laboratory we can

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,140
actually engineer organisms so that we potentially have this be is a

74
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:05,000
potential lethal mutant. We can make that mutation in some mice, in heterozygous

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,040
mice, and then when we cross them together we look at the offspring and

76
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,040
see what the outcome is. If this is a truly a lethal mutation, none of the offspring are

77
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:23,560
going to carry this particular mutation because they're all dead or they're non-viable. They're

78
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,280
only going to be able to look and observe these particular genotypes on the right here. We

79
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:38,680
have at least one dominant allele or big B allele. So if you cannot observe any recessive

80
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,760
homozygous organisms, it tells you that allele is actually lethal.

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,440
So in the real world, we do have examples of dominant recessive alleles that infect

82
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
health.

83
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:54,680
So the genes involved in cystic fibrosis actually are found as recessive alleles.

84
00:06:54,680 --> 00:07:01,880
And they may not be 100% lethal because people can grow and live with cystic fibrosis, but

85
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,640
you understand that those particular people have both of these alleles here

86
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,880
and they know when you're as healthy as people who have a normal copy of the

87
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,640
cystic fibrosis gene.
