> The [[Cards/Stomach\|stomach]] is divided into four regions: The cardiac is where the contents of the oesophagus empty into the [[Cards/Stomach\|stomach]]. Near the cardiac is the lower oesophageal sphincter. The [[Cards/Fundus of the Stomach\|Fundus of the Stomach]] of the [[Cards/Stomach\|stomach]] (from Latin, "bottom") is formed by the upper curvature of the organ. The body of the [[Cards/Stomach\|stomach]] is the main, central region. The [[Cards/Pylorus\|Pylorus]] (from Greek, "gatekeeper") is the lower section of the organ that facilitates emptying the contents into the [[Cards/Small Intestine\|small intestine]].

> [[Cards/Gastric Rugae\|Gastric Rugae]] (3) allow the [[Cards/Stomach\|stomach]] to enlarge without damage.

> The small intestine is approx. 3 to 5 metres long and has three distinct regions: [[Cards/Duodenum\|Duodenum]]: 5% of the length [[Cards/Jejunum\|Jejunum]]: almost 40% of the length Ileum: almost 60% of the length  
  
<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>  
> The [[Cards/Duodenum\|duodenum]] is the shortest part of the small intestine (about 20–25 cm long) and is shaped like a "C“. It is where preparation for absorption begins.  
  
<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>  
> The [[Cards/Jejunum\|jejunum]] is the midsection of the small intestine connecting the [[Cards/Duodenum\|duodenum]] to the ileum.  
  
<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>  
> Products of digestion (sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids) are absorbed into the bloodstream within this region.  
  
<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>  
> The ileum is the final section of the small intestine. It is about 3m long (60% of the length). It absorbs mainly [[Cards/Vitamin B12\|vitamin B12]] and [[Cards/Bile acids\|bile acids]], as well as any other remaining [[Cards/Nutrients\|nutrients]]. The ileum joins to the [[Cards/Cecum\|cecum]] of the [[Cards/Large Intestine\|large intestine]] at the ileocecal junction.  
  
<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>  
> The [[Cards/Large Intestine\|large intestine]], also known as the [[Cards/Large Intestine\|colon]], is the last part of the [[Cards/Gastrointestinal tract\|gastrointestinal tract]] and of the digestive system (approximately 1.5m in length). Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as faeces before being removed by defecation.  
  
<mark style="background-color: #ffd400">Quote</mark>  
> Most sources define the [[Cards/Large Intestine\|large intestine]] as the combination of the [[Cards/Cecum\|cecum]], [[Cards/Large Intestine\|colon]], [[Cards/Rectum\|rectum]], and [[Cards/Anal Cavity\|anal canal]].
