> Laws: • Generalizations based on repeated observations describing how things behave under specific conditions. • Descriptive statements summarizing observed phenomena without providing an explanation. • Example: Law of Conservation of Mass states that the mass of all material involved in a change remains constant.

> Theories: • Developed based on results from multiple experiments and observations. • Are predictive, but never proven. It is pointless to say that a theory is correct. • Example: Atomic theory posits that all matter is made of indestructible atoms.

> Hypotheses: • Initial ideas seeking to explain a phenomenon but not yet thoroughly tested or widely accepted. • Requires further experimentation for confirmation or rejection. • No clear demarcation between a hypothesis and a theory.

> Rules: • Generalizations simplifying complex systems by identifying common patterns. • Similar to laws, they make no theoretical claim but acknowledge exceptions. • Example: The octet rule states that atoms react to form a full octet (eight) electrons in their [[Cards/Valence Shell\|Valence Shell]], applying to specific elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen in biology. It has exceptions, but its usefulness lies in systematizing our understanding.
