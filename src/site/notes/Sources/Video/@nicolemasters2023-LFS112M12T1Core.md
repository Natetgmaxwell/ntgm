## Transcript
OK, so this is part B of topic twelve point one as highly recommended that you watch Part A first before you continue on with this video. OK, so back to our overview of the sensory and motor pathways we've talked now about the arriving stimulus and the different sensory receptors that occur. We're now going to talk about the downstream consequences of these stimuli, and that is the different steps of the sensory pathway. Now a stimulus picked up by a sensory receptor produces a graded change in the potential of the cell membrane of that receptor cell or sensory receptor. Now, another way to phrase this is that that stimulus causes a depolarization of the sensory receptor. And you've learned about depolarization earlier in the semester. So hopefully this is familiar to you, this concept. Now, if that stimulus is significant enough and depolarizes that cell membrane of the receptor cell to threshold, that will cause an action potential to develop from that sensory receptor cell. That action potential is then propagated, down the axons of the sensory neurons. So it will carry that information about the type of stimulus which has generated this action potential and takes that information through to the [[Cards/Central Nervous System\|central nervous system]] for processing. So remember, this process of converting physical stimulus to an electrical stimulus is called transduction. If that stimulus is significant enough, then action potential is generated and then it is propagated, are carried through to the [[Cards/Central Nervous System\|central nervous system]].

OK, so now we're going to talk about a concept called sensory coding. I'm going to stick with our tactile receptors in the skin to try and explain this concept. So when we are aware of someone touching us on our skin, we pick up different aspects of the stimuli. So it could be a light touch versus a touch, which has a lot of weight behind it. It could be quite a sharp touch or it could feel quite dull or it could be a fleeting touch or it could be quite sustained. OK, so this is the same kind of tactile stimuli, but we are picking up all these different aspects of that particular touch. And so the strength, duration and variation of that stimuli are communicated through to the central nervous system to be processed by the frequency and pattern of action potentials which are generated and then propagated. OK. So if you can pick up all these different aspects of a particular stimuli, that's a very complex sensory information and that is converted into specific patterns of action potentials. And that's what we mean by sensory coding.

Now, there's one more aspect to sensory receptors that we are going to discuss now, because it relates to how often they generate action potentials. Now, there are two different categories of receptors, tonic or phasic receptors, and this refers to how frequently action potentials are generated by these receptors. Now, if you look at figure A here, we can see that tonic receptors are always active. So if we look at the stimulus represented by the slide here where we have background levels of stimulus and then there's a period of time where we have this increased amount of stimulus, which then goes back down to normal, we can see that the frequency of action potentials generated by tonic receptors reflects the background level of stimulation. So even when we have this really low background level of stimulus, this kind of receptor is still firing off action potentials at a slow rate. When that stimulus is increased, you can see that that frequency of action, potential generation increases. OK. And then when that stimulus goes back down to background levels, that generation of action potential also slows down. So there's never a period of time where these tonic receptors aren't generating action potentials. It's just that that frequency increases when the stimulus increases and decreases in again accordingly when the stimulus decreases. This is in contrast to Phasic receptors, which are normally inactive, so you can see when there's background level of stimuli, there are no generation of action potentials by these receptors. And then action potentials are only generated when there is a change in stimulus. So it only these action potentials are only generated when there's an increase in that stimulus or when there's a decrease in that stimulus. OK, so those action potentials are only generated for a very short time and it indicates that there is a change in the condition that they are monitoring.

Now, we have a table here to help us understand the difference here, so we are going to go through some of these different characteristics. So for the information transmitted to summarize what we've just said, a tonic receptor. We'll send information when the stimulus is present and how strong it is where as aphasic preceptor, it will only send information when a stimulus is changing. And some of the aspects of that stimulus that it might record is changing. Is the rate of that stimulus or the intensity.

So how about the rate of action, potential formation, so  for tonic receptors, the rate of generating these action potentials is gradual and constant, so they're always active and the change is gradual. Whereas for a [[Cards/Phasic Receptor\|phasic receptor]], they're normally inactive, remember, and when there is action, potential formation, there's this quick generation of action potentials when something is changing and then that quickly tapers off to no action potentials being generated.

So some examples of these different kinds of receptors or some examples of tonic receptors, nociceptors, remember, they pick up on pain photoreceptors, they monitor changes and light. Phasic receptors, some examples of these are like thermoreceptors, so this will monitor changes in temperature and then olfactory cells. These are the receptors responsible for smell.

Now, another aspect that distinguishes these two receptors is their adaptation to stimulus. How quickly do they generate these action potentials when they are stimulated? So a tonic receptor is considered slow acting and a [[Cards/Phasic Receptor\|phasic receptor]] is considered rapid acting. And this is important when it we're going to next talk about how [[Cards/Sensory Adaptation\|Sensory Adaptation]] occurs.

OK, so what is [[Cards/Sensory Adaptation\|Sensory Adaptation]]? This is when there is a reduction in the sensitivity of a stimulus to our sensory receptors when there is a constant stimulus. Now, an important factor to this adaptation is that the stimulus cannot be pain. We don't adapt to painful stimulus because it's important for us to always know when that's happening. But there are other senses which we can get used to, and that's a process of adaptation. Now, there's two different kinds of adaptation, peripheral and central, and we're first going to discuss peripheral adaptation. So this kind of adaptation, peripheral adaptation occurs when receptor activity levels change. So there might be an initial strong receptor response when a stimulus begins, but then after a while, activity declines. This kind of adaptation only occurs when you have fast acting receptors and remember it, that refers to Phasic receptors. So generally they're inactive and then they generate action potential when there is a change in the condition that they are monitoring. So an example of the kind of peripheral adaptation that occurs via these fast acting phasic receptors. So things like constant noises, so, for example, when the air con turns on, initially, you might be aware that that sound has begun, but because it then continues constantly, we no longer become consciously aware of that sound, even though it's still there, we just get used to it. We adapt to that consistent noise. Another example that I have on the screen is thermoreceptors, you rarely notice a change in temperature unless it changes quite suddenly, but often you can be sitting, working for a long period of time and you're not registering that. You are getting colder and colder until a long time has passed and you suddenly realize, oh, I better go put a jumper on. So these are examples of the kind of peripheral that that adaptation that can occur due to those fast acting phasic receptors.

Now, tonic receptors, the ones that are kind of always firing off action potentials just at different frequencies, these kinds of receptors generally don't exhibit peripheral adaptation. OK, so remember these are the slow acting receptors. An example of this is the nociceptors, so those pain receptors, you're always constantly aware of pain. You never get a reduction in sensitivity, even if that pain is constant.

So while peripheral adaptation reflects sensory receptor activity, central adaptation reflects changes in the activity of the sensory pathways. And it's a similar kind of situation in which you were exposed to a new stimulus, which goes on for a long period of time, and after a while you no longer have conscious awareness of that stimulus. But in this instance, it's not a reflection of diminished sensory receptor activity. Those neurons are actually still active, but it's the downstream sensory pathway that is inhibited in central adaptation. An example of this is a new smell which is stimulating our olfactory cells in our nose. So, for example, you might enter a new space and there's a really nice smell of baking bread. For example, after a period of time, our conscious awareness of that smell diminishes even those odorants, those Stimulants for the olfactory cells are still there.

So why do we undergo [[Cards/Sensory Adaptation\|Sensory Adaptation]]? Now as we've previously mentioned, there are a lot of stimuli which we are constantly processing and reacting to every moment, and it's thought that this [[Cards/Sensory Adaptation\|Sensory Adaptation]] process allows us to prioritize the stimuli which is really critical for us to process and react to in order to survive. So something like a consistent noise or a consistent smell, which we've kind of already realized is not going to cause us any harm, we can kind of diminish its importance. So we have these two different kinds of adaptation, because they slightly they work slightly differently for peripheral adaptation limits, the amount of information will actually be relayed towards the central nervous system for that processing, integration and reaction, whereas the central adaptation restricts the amount of information that reaches the processing centers in the brain where that integration of information occurs.

OK, so we're ready to discuss the next stage and the next stage is processing of this information by the central nervous system. Now, the central nervous system processing occurs at several different stages along the pathway of that signal, getting from the sensory pathway through to the brain, and this is because that information crosses over a number of synapses. So remember, synapses are spaces between nervous cells and the signals propagated over those spaces by the release of neurotransmitters. Now, the first synapses when relaying this information towards the central nervous system happens in the [[Cards/Spinal cord\|spinal cord]] or [[Cards/Brain Stem\|brain stem]]. Now, processing centers in these locations in the [[Cards/Spinal cord\|spinal cord]] or [[Cards/Brain Stem\|brain stem]] can cause an immediate reflex response. So if we follow these arrows, which come out of the CNS processing box here and we take this first arrow and we see this motor pathway, involuntary branch of the response, this is the outcome from the processing of that sensory information by the [[Cards/Spinal cord\|spinal cord]], or [[Cards/Brain Stem\|brain stem]], so we can respond to that sensory information before that signal even gets propagated all the way to the brain. So an example of an immediate involuntary response would be the reflex or withdrawal. So if you touch a really hot surface, you get immediate withdrawal response that occurs is the information being processed at the level of the [[Cards/Spinal cord\|spinal cord]] or brainstem. So that information hasn't even got to the brain yet, but we have immediately reacted to withdraw from something that is harming us. Another example of an immediate involuntary response is a sneeze.

Now, the stimulus can continue being propagated through to the brain, through to the initially the thalamus, and this is where we begin to have conscious perception of that stimulus. And then there's a further synapse to take that information through to the primary somatosensory cortex, which is a distinct region of the brain. And we will talking about that in a few slides time. So if we have conscious perception of that sensory stimulus, we can again focus our further down towards the bottom branch and this is when we have conscious perception of that stimulus. Now, we can see here that only one percent of the arriving sensory information is actually relayed all the way through to that primary somatosensory cortex. That's the region of the brain, which helps to process and integrate all the sensory information. And so once we have conscious perception, that's when we can have a measured voluntary response to that stimulus. So this is not an immediate response. So we can supplement that involuntary reflexive response, so if we have touched something hot with immediate involuntary responses to withdraw our hand very quickly, but our voluntary response is what occurs after that so we can choose to then go on and run our fingers under the tap or apply first aid so that some more measured moderate response.

So this leads us to discussing the different areas of the brain which are responsible for the processing and integration of sensory information. So remember, if this information has reached the brain, it means that we have conscious perception of these sensory stimuli. And so that means that each of these locations in the brain are sensory information, which remember is neuronal activity has been reported. Now, we're going to start by identifying where that primary somatosensory complex is that we introduced in the previous slide. So this is found in this darker blue area of the brain in the figure here. And for those of you that agree that brain anatomy that's in the central gyrus area of the parietal lobe. Now, this area of the brain receives somatic sensory information for a wide range of different senses, including touch, pressure, pain, vibration, changes in temperature and even a little bit of information from our gustatory cells which are responsible for taste. We also have the visual cortex, which is found in the occipital lobe here. And that receives information from the photoreceptors in the eye, so obviously processes visual information.

The temporal lobe here contains both the auditory cortex and the olfactory cortex, so the auditory cortex, obviously receives information from the ear about hearing and the olfactory cortex here receives information about smell.

Now, despite the fact that the primary somatosensory cortex does receive some information from gustatory cells, there is a specific area which is called the gustatory cortex, which receives information from the taste receptors. So that's this area in the purple on this figure here, which is the anterior portion of the insula and also the adjacent portions of the frontal lobe. OK, now each of these sensory areas of the brain are connected to nearby association areas here, so we have this somatosensory association cortex, which is close by that primary somatosensory cortex. OK, and the function of these association areas is that it monitors and interprets incoming data before it can be acted upon. OK.

All right, so we've discussed the areas of the brain which is responsible for that conscious perception of sensory information processing and integration, and the last thing to discuss when it comes to going through this figure is the areas of the brain which are responsible for controlling that voluntary response to the sensory information. So the voluntary response to sensory information occurs via voluntary movement, and it's the primary motor cortex which is responsible for directing voluntary movement. Now, the pre- motor cortex, which we also have highlighted here, acts like the somatic motor association area. And so it's responsible for processing and initiating voluntary motor activities and the coordination of learned movements. So basically, what the premotor cortex does is that it ensures that if you do a motion over and over again with repetition, the movements will become smoother and easier to do. And it does this by triggering a pattern of movement rather than controlling individual neurons. All right, so the last thing that we're going to talk about are these integrative centers in the brain, so these are areas of the brain that receive information from many different association areas and direct, really complex motor activities. As an example of this kind of integration center is this Wernicke's area, so that receives information from all the sensory association areas and allows the coordination.

Of complex visual and auditory memories, so what that means is allows you to link visual information to being able to name an object. So if you see a chair, you it's the processing of that information in the integrative center in Wernicke's area which allows you to link the word chair to the object that you are seeing with those photoreceptors. OK. Now, the prefrontal cortex, which occurs in this area of the brain here in the blue, in the frontal lobe, integrates sensory information as well, but it is involved in intellectual functions such as predicting outcomes of the information you have received. So, for example, if you smell burning, it's the prefrontal cortex that figures out that that smell might be linked to the cake that you're making and have left for too long in the oven.
