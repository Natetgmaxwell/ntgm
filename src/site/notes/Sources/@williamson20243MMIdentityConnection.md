> 3 deep questions to connect with your partner.  1. What feelings are hard for you to communicate? How can I make it  easier?  2. What is a compromise you've had to make since meeting me?  3. What was the most recent experience that made you feel closer to  me?

> Stories don’t care about your statistics.  In controlled experiments, researchers documented a pronounced  story-statistic gap in memory:  The average impact of statistics on beliefs fades by 73% over the  course of a day.  The impact of a story fades by only 32%. So in short, people's beliefs are more durably impacted by stories than  by statistics.  Huge implications for how voters’ beliefs can be more easily swayed  during the upcoming elections.
