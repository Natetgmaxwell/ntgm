> Summary The three traits that predict happiness in relationships are conscientiousness, low neuroticism, and high emotional stability. Conscientiousness involves being kind but also attentive, intelligent, and motivated. It is about anticipating and meeting the needs of the partner. Low neuroticism refers to emotional stability and owning one's emotions, while high emotional stability means having overall happiness and life satisfaction. Having a partner with serious emotional distress or instability can be challenging for the other partner. ðŸ“š Transcript Speaker 1 But here's what I love about Thai Tashiro is he didn't stop there. He wanted to know what those people who were happy had in common. And then same thing with the people who were unhappy. He found a couple fascinating patterns. So the couples who were happy tended to rate their partners higher in three different traits. And I love talking about this because if you are somebody who can follow instructions, you can find this. I mean, very easily. Those three traits tend to be conscientiousness. Okay, and I love the word conscientiousness because it's not just kindness. Kindness is a good way to think of it, but you can be kind and kind of be a pushover and that's not attractive. Conscientiousness is smart, attentive. It's somebody who reads into a text message and thinks, wow, she was making herself very vulnerable there. That's conscientiousness. I like how you just threw in a compliment. But it's true. It's a certain intelligence awareness and attunement. And then on top of that, conscientiousness is motivated. So you can't be on your ass all day and be conscientious, because then you can't meet the needs that you anticipate about the person. So conscientious is that guy who drives the car around in the rainstorm. So his wife's hair doesn't get met. It's my husband who checks my alarm for me every morning because he knows I'm terrible at time management. And he makes sure that I set it a reasonable amount of time before my first meeting and not the 20 minutes I think I need. And then he'll come wake me up with a cup of coffee. That is ultimate conscientiousness. And it is true. I mean, I will tell you, as somebody who's with a conscientious partner, your love increases over time as you continue to feel grateful and admiring of that person. The second one, you want somebody who is low in a big five personality trait calledÂ  neuroticism. You want somebody emotionally stable in a way.Â  Now this doesn't mean you can't have somebody who doesn't get theÂ  blues or struggle with mental health issues. Trust me, Ty is withÂ  somebody who, you know, I get I'm all over the place. But you wantÂ  somebody who kind of owns their shit and isn't going to just beÂ  emotionally unstable all over, you know, you want somebody who isÂ  generally happy and has some life satisfaction. Having a partner whoÂ  has serious not mental health issues, but unmitigated emotional distressÂ  and instability is really hard on the partner.
