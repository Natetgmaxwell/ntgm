> [!Abstract]+
> Bacterial species have different coping mechanisms with selective harsh environmental conditions. One of the most common coping mechanisms for bacteria is forming spores to protect themselves against ecological degrading agents. Bacterial spores are the most dormant form of bacteria since they exhibit minimal metabolism and respiration, as well as reduced enzyme production.
