> [!Abstract]+
> The Ape that Understood the Universe is the story of the strangest animal in the world: the human animal. It opens with a question: How would an alien scientist view our species? What would it make of our sex differences, our sexual behavior, our child-rearing patterns, our moral codes, our religions, our languages, and science? The book tackles these issues by drawing on ideas from two major schools of thought: evolutionary psychology and cultural evolutionary theory. The guiding assumption is that humans are animals, and that like all animals, we evolved to pass on our genes. At some point, however, we also evolved the capacity for culture - and from that moment, culture began evolving in its own right. This transformed us from a mere ape into an ape capable of reshaping the planet, travelling to other worlds, and understanding the vast universe of which we're but a tiny, fleeting fragment.

> In short, just as natural selection culls less seaworthy boats from the population of boats, and less rewarded behaviors from the individual’s population of behaviors, so too selection culls less learnable, less useful words from each language’s population of words. The inevitable result is that languages evolve to be more learnable and more useful over time.

> So, one way a meme can spread itself in the culture is by boosting its owners’ longevity. Another is by boosting its owners’ reproductive success.  Any meme that encourages its bearers to have lots of children inevitably upgrades its chances of spreading.78 This is because children tend to inherit the belief systems of their parents and the parents’ community, and therefore fertility-promoting memes automatically build lots of new homes for themselves.
