> If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations of creatures, what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is the atomic hypothesis (or the atomic fact, or whatever you wish to call it) that all things are made of atoms—little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. In that one sentence, you will see, there is an enormous amount of information about the world, if just a little imagination and thinking are applied.

> Let us consider another situation. Suppose that the piston moves inward, so that the atoms are slowly compressed into a smaller space. What happens when an atom hits the moving piston? Evi-dently it picks up speed from the collision. You can try it by bounc-ing a ping-pong ball from a forward-moving paddle, for example, and you will find that it comes off with more speed than that with which it struck. (Special example: if an atom happens to be stand-ing still and the piston hits it, it will certainly move.) So the atoms are “hotter” when they come away from the piston than they werebefore they struck it. Therefore all the atoms which are in the vesselwill have picked up speed. This means that when we compress a gas slowly, the temperature of the gas increases. So, under slow compression,a gas will increase in temperature, and under slow expansion it will decrease in temperature

> If we then take the top of the vessel off and blow the moist air away, replacing it with dry air, then the number of molecules leaving is just the same as it was before, because this depends on the jiggling of the water, but the number coming back is greatly reduced because there are so many fewer water molecules above the water.

> No, there are no internal wheels; nature, as weunderstand it today, behaves in such a way that it is fundamentallyimpossible to make a precise prediction of exactly what will happenin a given experiment. This is a horrible thing; in fact, philosophershave said before that one of the fundamental requisites of scienceis that whenever you set up the same conditions, the same thing must happen. This is simply not true; it is not a fundamental con-dition of science. The fact is that the same thing does not happen, that we can find only an average, statistically, as to what happens.

> So quantum mechanics unifies the idea ofthe field and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the field aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate description in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become moreevident with the equipment with which we usually make the mea-surements.
