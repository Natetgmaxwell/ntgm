> Foreword by Ben Greenfield:

"WIN is undoubtedly one of the most evidence-based books on athletic performance.

It teaches you the underlying pillars to physical development and fitness, such as nutrition, muscle growth, fat loss, body composition optimization, recovery, supplementation and so much more.

Not only are there specific protocols that have been formulated in the book, but all the recommendations are backed by a wealth of scientific evidence.

This book is suitable for both beginners, as well as advanced athletes, complete science nerds, body builders, the average Joe or Jane wanting to lose an extra few pounds, as well as top tier elite athletes.

If I had this information available to me when I was competing, I know that it would have given me a significant advantage. I hope you enjoy WIN as much as I have!"

What you will learn and what is covered in WIN
How to improve athletic performance
How to lose weight
How to build muscle
Meal plans
Recipes
How to support the immune system
How to improve sleep
The most evidence-based supplements
And A LOT MORE!

> Key take-aways for carbohydrate intake prior to exercise Consuming something like maple syrup or orange juice (which contains fairly equal amounts of glucose and fructose) 30-45 minutes prior to exercise is a good way to help replenish muscle glycogen levels during high-intensity exercise. Maple syrup also contains numerous minerals including manganese which is hard to get in the diet. 
> Consuming high molecular weight starches, such as Vitargo® or Glycofuse® 1 hour prior to intense exercise may increase speed, performance and recovery compared to other carbohydrates, such as maize starch, highly branched cyclic dextrin and super-starch. These high molecular weight starches may also have less risk for inducing blood sugar drops, bloating and can even improve subsequent exercise performance[605],[606] .  Typically, around 25-75 grams of carbohydrates are consumed 30-60 minutes prior to performance

The 3 main variables of effective training are: Volume – the total quantity of movement performed during each exercise, training session and training cycle.  Intensity – the amount of load, weight lifted, speed attained.  Intensity is the qualitative component of training. It’s about doing more work per unit of time.  Frequency – how often you train, i.e., how many times per week you execute certain movements. This is another quantitative aspect, but it is more concerned with recovery
