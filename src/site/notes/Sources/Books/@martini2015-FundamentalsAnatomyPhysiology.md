> [!Abstract]  
> Fundamentals of Anatomy & Physiology helps you succeed in the challenging A & P course with an easy-to-understand narrative, precise visuals, and steadfast accuracy. Every chapter of the Tenth Edition includes one and two page Spotlight Figures that seamlessly integrate text and visuals to guide you through complex topics and processes. These highly visual presentations incorporate, for select topics, the "visual approach" that the same author team created in their Visual Anatomy & Physiology book. New Clinical Cases open every chapter and get you thinking about the chapter content in the context of a personal compelling patient story. The Tenth Edition integrates book content with Mastering A & P®, through expanded Coaching Activities, which personalize learning and coach you toward understanding and mastery of tough A & P topics. -- Provided by publisher

> 1. Produce Skeletal Movement. Skeletal muscle contractions pull on tendons to move our bones. Their effects range from simple motions, such as extending the arm or breathing, to the highly coordinated movements of swimming, skiing, or playing a piano. 2. Maintain Posture and Body Position. Tension in our skeletal muscles maintains body posture—for example, holding your head still when you read a book or balancing your body weight above your feet when you walk. Without constant muscular activity, we could neither sit upright nor stand. 3. Support Soft Tissues. Layers of skeletal muscle make up the abdominal wall and the floor of the pelvic cavity. These muscles support the weight of our visceral organs and shield our internal tissues from injury. 4. Guard Body Entrances and Exits. Skeletal muscles encircle the openings of the digestive and urinary tracts. These muscles give us voluntary control over swallowing, defecating, and urinating. 5. Maintain Body Temperature. Muscle contractions use energy, and whenever energy is used in the body, some of it is converted to heat. The heat released by working muscles keeps body temperature in the range needed for normal functioning. 6. Store Nutrients. When our diet contains too few proteins or calories, the contractile proteins in skeletal muscles are broken down, and their amino acids released into the circulation. The liver can use some of these amino acids to synthesize glucose, and others can be broken down to provide energy.
