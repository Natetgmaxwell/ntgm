## Transcript

Module 2, Section 4, Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors. The diagram on the left-hand side is one that I showed you in the previous section. It illustrates the nerve-stimulated release of acetylcholine from motor neurons into the synapse. Now from here, the acetylcholine will diffuse across the synapse to the target cell and interact with nicotinic receptors. These nicotinic receptors are ligand-gated ion channels and they allow the influx of sodium into the cell, resulting in membrane depolarization. An action potential is transmitted through the membrane and ultimately this leads to contraction of the skeletal muscle fiber. The end plate potential within the skeletal muscle fiber persists for a very short period of time estimated to be only about 1 to 2 milliseconds in duration. And this is because the acetylcholine is very rapidly metabolized. The metabolism occurs through the activity of an enzyme called acetylcholine esterase or ACE. Now acetylcholinesterase is extremely efficient in metabolizing acetylcholine to largely biological inactive metabolites acetate plus choline. 10,000 acetylcholine molecules are metabolized every second or if you want to put this a slightly different way the turnover rate of acetylcholine is 100 microseconds. We have enzyme inhibitors, inhibitors of the acetylcholine esterase and these can be either reversible inhibitors or irreversible inhibitors. Phisostigmine, also known as Azerene, is an example of a competitive reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. And this enzyme inhibitor is located within the calabar bean. There's an interesting history behind this calabar bean. It has been used in medieval times to determine the guilt or innocence of an individual. The so-called trial by ordeal comes from the ordeal bean. So what they did back in the day was to take eight caliber beans to crush them up and infuse the contents, the alkaloids, from the bean into water. And this was then given to the individual who was being charged with a crime. and they were to ingest that liquid. If they died, then they must have been guilty. If they happened to survive, maybe they vomited up the contents and survived, then they were deemed to be innocent. Phisostigmine has an elimination half-life of about 15 minutes. Unlike acetylcholine, which causes muscle contraction, phisostigmine does not. Now this is not the case with every acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Neostigmine is another acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that also causes some contraction of the skeletal muscle. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used clinically for the management of patients with Alzheimer's disease, with myothenia gravis. this is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies are directed against the nicotinic receptors of the skeletal muscle leading to muscle weakness, paralytic ilius anatomy, lack of normal muscle tone of the urinary bladder and also in the management of patients with glaucoma. This is a disease of the eye in which there is an increase in intraocular pressure. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are also used in agriculture as insecticides and for other nefarious reasons such as warfare and terrorism. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors particularly they are gonna phosphate compounds have been used as nerve agents as homicidal agents and in some cases also as suicidal agents. The pharmacokinetics of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is largely determined by the chemical structure of the compound. Some of these compounds have a quaternary ammonium group, so that is to say there are four bonds to a nitrogen. Now as I've talked about previously, this leads to a permanent positive charge on the molecule and as a consequence of this positive charge, the agent diffuses across membranes quite poorly. So the agents that contain the quaternary ammonium group are poorly absorbed across the gastrointestinal tract, they're poorly absorbed across the skin and they tend to be excluded from the central nervous system because they don't travel easily across the blood-brain barrier. Contrast this with lipid soluble agents which are largely the organophosphate compounds, these are very well absorbed across non aqueous barriers such as plasma membranes. So if the organophosphate compound is ingested this will be absorbed readily across the gastrointestinal tract. It will be absorbed rapidly across the skin and will lent of the central nervous system. This is an interesting study that was published. It's quite an old study. It was published back in 2011. And it described the symptoms that were exhibited by tractor mounted sprayers. Okay, so this is the use of organophosphate compounds in the agricultural industry. And you can see some guys here that are spraying the insecticide into the trees. Now, what's most notable about the diagram here and was described in this particular study is that these workers were not using any personal protective equipment. So you can see a lot of exposed skin and you can see in this case, the guy is spraying the organophosphate compound into the trees over the left shoulder of this person. In this study, they identified that there was an exposure duration around about 13 years. Interestingly, 55% of the sprayers were aware of pesticide toxicity, which means that 45% of the individuals in this industry had no idea that the sprays that they were using were potentially harmful. None of the individuals who were interviewed for this study used personal protective equipment, which is really quite surprising and obviously of concern. The reasons stated for the lack of use of personal protective equipment is that the personal protective equipment was not provided by the employer and the employees did not have the resources in order to be able to purchase that for themselves. The study went on to identify the symptoms that were exhibited within the sprayers compared to control individuals who were not working within the industry. And this is illustrated here. So 64% of the sprayers had effects on the nervous system compared to 20% of the controls. 64% of the sprayers had ocular effects compared to 17% of the controls. 36% of the sprayers had respiratory effects, 10% in the control cohort. As I mentioned a moment ago, the organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can produce harmful effects because they are very lipid soluble and they will pass across membranes very readily. Sarin and soman are compounds that have been developed as so-called nerve gases. So what this is really describing are compounds that have inhibitory effects on the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. So Sarin was developed in World War II as a potential nerve gas. The organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors have been used in terrorism and warfare over the years. For example, back in 2017 the half-brother of Kim Jong-un, Kim Jong-nam was assassinated by application of the nerve agent, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, VX. The two people over here were charged. So Sidi Asiya and Doun Hwang applied the Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor to NAM in the International Airport of Kuala Lumpur. They were charged but they were released two years later so they were released in 2019. Another very famous case of an individual being exposed to an Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor as an act of terrorism is that of Sergei Skripal. Skripal was a former Russian military intelligence officer who was also a double agent for the UK intelligence service. He was found out and picked up by Russian operatives and convicted of high treason and sentenced to 13 years in prison. He eventually settled in the UK after a spy swap. However, the Russians weren't particularly happy about this and they send a couple of Russian operatives across to the UK to deal with the situation. These operatives poisoned Skripal and also his daughter, Yulia, by application of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor Novichok. So here it is thought that they sprayed the Novichok onto the door handle of their house, and when they touched the door handle they were then exposed to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. They happened to survive this, however the story was not so good for Dawn Sturgis, who was somebody who was living in the same town, Salisbury. It is thought that what happened was that the Russian operatives brought across the Novichok in a perfume bottle and they sprayed the door handle and then discarded the bottle, which was later picked up by the partner of Sturgis, who then gave it to Sturgis, who sprayed the contents on herself thinking that it was perfume. Of course it was Novichok and the exposure to the Novichok in this case led to lethal effects. One more famous case of the use of the organophosphate compounds as an act of terrorism occurred in 1995 in a Tokyo subway. Here a terrorist group released sarin into the subway and as you can imagine the subways can be fairly crowded. It's estimated that about 6,000 people were exposed to the sarin and of these 13 individuals died. Now death was associated with the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase leading to overactivation of the muscarinic and nicotinic receptors. The overactivation of nicotinic receptors in the respiratory muscles such as the diaphragm led to the depolarizing blockade, depolarizing neuromuscular blockade. The respiratory muscles are not contracting and relaxing then this leads to respiratory failure. There were also psychological and non-lethal toxic effects of the serum. A study reported the psychological effects of the exposure of individuals in the subway to Sarin and many of the individuals reported anxiety as well as phobias of subways, sleep disturbances, flashbacks and depression. There are also non-lethal toxic effects in association with over-activation of nicotinic and muscarinic receptors and these are shown here vomiting, diarrhea, salivation, excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, pinpoint pupil, bradycardia, hypotension as well as hypertension, fasciculations and tachycardia. Treatment of the individuals includes removal of the sarin where there is exposure as well as a combination of psychiatric and pharmacological therapies and I'm going to expand upon that a little bit more in this section but also especially within the tutorials. These are some of the effects associated with exposure to organophosphate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as Sarin. In the eyes it can cause meiosis and blurred vision. In the airways bronchoconstriction and excessive bronchosucretions. In the gastrointestinal tract it can cause hypermotility of the gut, excessive secretions, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. skeletal muscle, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors cause fasciculations in association with the activation of the nicotinic receptors, but this can then give way to paralysis and weakness associated with depolarizing neuromuscular blockade and in the central nervous system loss of consciousness and seizures. Organophosphate compounds such as sarin will interact with the acetylcholinesterase enzyme leading to its phosphorylation and inhibition. There is very slow spontaneous hydrolysis that leads to the reactivation of the acetylcholinesterase but this is really slow. If a process of aging occurs where there is removal of this side chain associated with organophosphate compound, the inhibitor becomes ionized and in its ionized state this becomes truly irreversible inhibition.
