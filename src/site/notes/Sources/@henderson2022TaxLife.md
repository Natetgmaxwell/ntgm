> There’s a phrase that a lot of people from intact families take for  granted:  “My dad always says...” Other variations include “My dad taught me..”  and “My dad likes to say...”  I went the first seventeen years of my life seldom hearing anything like  this. Then I joined the Air Force and heard it on occasion from my  fellow military members. When I reached college, I heard it a lot.  A few off the top of my head:  “My old man likes to say that if you want to win you gotta hang with  winners.”  “My dad taught me that cooking is an art but baking is a science.”  “My dad always says if you’re going to do something stupid, at least be  smart about it.”

> Some years ago I was at a birthday dinner with my former First  Sergeant who had recently been reassigned to another unit. We were seated next to each other. His family chattered among themselves  while he and I spoke. After some small talk, he explained to me that  this was their tradition—for his wife and his kids to throw a birthday  dinner for him at this particular Marie Callender's. I said something like,  “You must really enjoy this if they do it every year for you.” He  shrugged, leaned over, and quietly mused, “To be honest, Henderson,  not really. I’d rather have a quiet evening at home. But it's a once a year  thing. It’s more for them,” he nodded toward his family, “than for me.”  And that imparted the lesson that spending time with others and  celebrating special occasions (even ones meant for you) isn’t about  you, it’s about everyone else.
