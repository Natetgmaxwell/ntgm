> A question that has long occupied philosophers, social scientists, advertising executives, and curious people more generally is, “What motivates people?” A popular answer is money. Money is the root of all evil. Follow the money. Money makes the world go round. I’m skeptical of this answer. No doubt money is a powerful incentive. But people will often pay a financial cost in order to obtain something even more valuable, something immaterial, something that exists only in the minds of other people: Social status.

> The nineteenth-century sociologist Max Weber defined status as “an effective claim to social esteem in terms of positive or negative privileges.” He characterized it as a form of social access. In A Theory of Human Motivation, the twentieth century psychologist Abraham Maslow defined status as “reputation or prestige, recognition, attention, importance, or appreciation.”

> The economist Chaim Fershtman defined status as “the ranking of individuals, or groups of individuals, based on attributes, actions, occupations, or group affiliations.” This is a modern definition, referencing occupation.

> Many people resist the idea that status is so important. But they don’t resist roughly equivalent terms. If you say you want a job promotion for the status, you might be judged harshly. But if you say you want to be promoted because you want respect, that’s often regarded as an appropriate desire.

> Evolution doesn’t “care” that much about survival. It “cares” mostly about reproduction. A trait that damages survival can still spread if it aids in reproduction. Risk-taking, for example, might put an animal in increased physical danger and thus greater odds of death. But if risk-taking is also, on average, associated with obtaining access to reproductive partners, or impressing reproductive partners, then this trait may still spread.

> Recently, scholars have suggested that there are in fact two different types of social status. The first is dominance. It is evolutionarily older and more widespread in the animal kingdom. Dominance in humans is associated with narcissism, aggression, and [[Cards/Disagreeableness\|Disagreeableness]]. Under the dominance framework, status is attained by instilling fear in others through [[Cards/Coercion\|Coercion]], [[Cards/Intimidation\|Intimidation]], and displays of brute force. People (and animals) confer status to dominant individuals because of what the individuals can do to them. Inflict costs, pain, [[Cards/Humiliation\|Humiliation]], injuries, disfigurement, [[Cards/Violence\|Violence]], reputation destruction, and so on. Joseph Stalin obtained status through dominance. The second type of status: Prestige. It is more evolutionarily recent and pervasive among humans. Prestige is associated with stable self-esteem, [[Cards/Social Acceptance\|Social Acceptance]], being well-liked, and the personality trait of conscientiousness. Prestige is freely conferred to individuals based on their knowledge, skills, or success. We confer status to prestigious individuals because of what these individuals can do for us. Provide benefits, teach useful things, grant access to resources, bolster our own status by being associated with them, and so on. Stephen Hawking obtained status through prestige.

> Finally there’s the development of our large brains and associated cognitive and linguistic capacities. Language enabled humans to spread rumors, form whisper networks, build consensus, and so on in order to target other individuals. Who were the targets of these organized attacks? Mostly, bullies. Men who attempted to assert unwanted dominance were the targets of organized attacks by their huntergatherer peers. This brings us to the self-domestication hypothesis, discussed at length by the Harvard evolutionary biologist in his book The Goodness Paradox. Wrangham asks a question: Why are humans so much more cooperative and peaceful compared with our nearest evolutionary relatives? Comparing within-group physical aggression among chimpanzees to human hunter-gatherer communities, chimps are 150 to 550 times more likely than humans to inflict [[Cards/Violence\|Violence]] against their peers. We tamed ourselves by weeding out bullies and domineering males throughout our evolutionary history. Humans organized egalitarian societies, and any male that violated this too much was subsequently the victim of a targeted killing. Slowly humans eliminated overt aggression and hostility, and we shaped ourselves into being relatively calm, docile, cooperative, and so on, relative to other great apes.

> Here’s the sociologist Ashley Mears in her terrific book Very Important People: "Free things are a clear marker of status in the VIP world. Free entry, drinks, and dinners signal recognition of a person’s social worth. ‘I always said, in nightlife it’s not what you spend, it’s what you get for free. That’s real power.’”

> Angelina Jolie wrote a viral op-ed in the New York Times documenting her decision to get screened for breast cancer. Some researchers found that this led to a nationwide increase in breast cancer screenings, and they dubbed this the “Angelina Effect.” If a prestigious person wears something or recommends something, people are likely to imitate them with no [[Cards/Coercion\|Coercion]] necessary.

> The psychologist Mark Leary and his colleagues have proposed that humans have a “sociometer.” This is a psychological mechanism that evolved to maintain self-esteem and social belonging. Everyone has a sociometer, and its purpose is to unconsciously monitor the social environment for signs of acceptance or rejection.
