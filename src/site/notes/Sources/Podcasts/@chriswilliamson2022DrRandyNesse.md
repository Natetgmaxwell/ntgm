> Speaker 1 A wonderful British biologist, recognized that you can do things that decrease your own reproduction even, and that can still be selected for so long as there are benefits to relatives Who have the exact same genes as you do, including those genes for cooperation. Speaker 2 What's an example of that? Speaker 1 Actually, the anecdote that one has to tell when talking about this is from the famous socialist biologist JBS Haldain back in the 40s. Someone asked them, but a pub, would you sacrifice your life for your brother? And he says, no, I don't think I would, but I went for two brothers or for eight cousins. And that really says it better than any fancy math I could #542  Dr Randy Nesse  Evolutionary Psychiatry Can Explain Human Emotions  4 do. But this idea that you can ensure that everybody in the group pulls for the good of the group, even at their personal cost, doesn't work in general. Now, human societies, we should note are different than that, because we organize groups on purpose to do stuff. More than that, there are leaders or groups who often are trying to exploit, not necessarily on purpose, but they're trying to get the group to do what's good for the group.
