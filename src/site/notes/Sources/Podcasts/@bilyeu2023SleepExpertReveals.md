> after some degree of sleep deprivation, you build up this pressure for the different stages of sleep. And one of the two main stages of sleep of human sleep, at least is something called rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep, which is the stage that is principally associated with dreaming. And what we've learned is that once you start to go through sleep deprivation and including REM sleep deprivation, the brain gets so starved of this thing called dream sleep that it Just simply says, look, at some point, I've got to get this thing called REM sleep. And if you're going to stay awake, I don't really care. I'm just going to produce this state of REM sleep. And so it's almost as though you're awake, but the veil of REM sleep dreaming comes over the brain. And therefore, you're essentially dreaming while you're awake. And that's why you start seeing these hallucinations and delusions.
