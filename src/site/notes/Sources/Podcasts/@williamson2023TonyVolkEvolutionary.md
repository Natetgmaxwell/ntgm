> Looking at modern civilization, then, school, we've spoken about an awful lot today, compared to an ancestral lifestyle, have we created an environment which is more conducive to Bullying is school a perfect storm for bullying? Speaker 1 Yes, and no. It's, well, certainly, yes. One of the things that mediates bullying, and Peter Gray wrote a really nice series of articles about this, is you have mixed aged and often mixed sex play in hunter-gatherer groups, Because for most times of the year, almost all hunter-gatherers live in small bands, about 20 to 25, and then seasonally, when times are good, they get together with the extended family 100, 150 for a few months. So most of the time, you only have, you know, let's say half the group or kids, you've got 12 kids to pick from. So it's harder to have these isolated cliques. Everybody sort of has to get along. And the mixed age play reduces the need to show off. 12-year-old doesn't need to show that they're better than their 8-year-old cousin. I think that's, it's #637  Tony Volk  The Evolutionary Psychology Of Bullying  4 a given. And the 12-year-old boy isn't as motivated to compete against the 12-year-old girl. Speaker 2 Right. So because each cohort that would be competing for status and is sufficiently similar in status for bullying to be a useful tool is so small, there is basically no point in, but there's One person from this age and this age and this age and this age at each gender. And that's it. Speaker 1 Right. And on top of that, most of them are going to be related. So that's kin selection. So that's a break on attacking copies of your genes and other bodies. So those are reasons why I think modern society, and in particular as well, you'd have adults who step in and are motivated to step in. And we know that one of the big factors that motivates teachers is whether they feel a motivated to be competent in intervening. Whereas in the past, you'd be living with your aunts and uncles and they would have no problems saying knock that off. In large part because that sort of behavior is rarely tolerated. The downside to ancestral environments is that the stakes could be potentially higher. So if you and I were siblings and there's one piece of meat, yes, you have 50% of my genes, but I have 100%. So unless I'm saving two of my brothers, I should be bullying to get that meat. And so the competition in that sense could be life or death, which would increase the benefit of engaging in bullying. So my guess is that bullying was probably less common in the past. But when it did happen, it had the potential to become very serious.
