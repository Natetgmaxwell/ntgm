> Summary Nearly half of Americans are diabetic or pre-diabetic, which are diseases of modernity. The four primary diseases that are killing us are heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and type 2 diabetes. These diseases account for the majority of death certificates. Type 2 diabetes, along with the entire spectrum of metabolic disease, is the fourth horseman, which multiplies the risk of the other three diseases. Therefore, addressing metabolic health is crucial in preventing and targeting these diseases. ðŸ“š Transcript Speaker 2 I was astonished to learn that nearly I think you say half of Americans are diabetic or pre diabetic it depends on the estimates those are estimates that are out there I would say the most Conservative estimate would be a third yeah so call it somewhere between a third and a half so you've identified four diseases four primary diseases that are that are killing us that Speaker 1 We are not addressing as well as we could and you call those the four horsemen right and all of these are diseases of modernity so these are diseases that didn't really exist in appreciable Quantities a hundred years ago three of these diseases are what I call big death certificate tickets meaning they're actually the ones that show up on the death certificates the most And those are all of the diseases of atherosclerosis which is heart disease and cerebrovascular disease so heart attacks and strokes that's number one by country mile cancer and then The entire suite of neurodegenerative diseases and dementing diseases so that's everything from Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia etc vascular dementia All these things so those three things account for the majority of death certificates and that's mostly I mean if if you include the entire population of smokers you have to include COPD in there I largely exclude that from this analysis because most people who are interested in living longer aren't smoking so you could argue there's a fifth horsemen in COPD but For the purpose of the way I'm thinking about it doesn't make sense the fourth horseman is not really a big death certificate ringer you're not gonna see him on a lot of death certificates In fact if you if you want to do the death certificate analysis he doesn't rank in the top five and that's type two diabetes but I expand that to include the entire spectrum of metabolic Disease that is prelude to that and that begins with hyperinsulinemia insulin resistance non-alcoholic fatty liver disease all the way out to type two diabetes and while that spectrum Of diseases again doesn't register at the same level as the other three horsemen what's very important toÂ  understand is that it's the force multiplier of them all so it's increasingÂ  Your odds of each of the other three horsemen by anywhere from 50 toÂ  100% and so it is the insidious thing that must be controlled you have toÂ  be metabolically healthy that is step one of This process right if you ifÂ  you want to take aim at the other three horsemen you must addressÂ  metabolic health your metabolic house as I say must be in order andÂ  then we can begin targeting The other three in specific diseaseÂ  prevention strategies.

> Summary  Divide your exercise time in half, with half dedicated to strength and  stability and half dedicated to cardio. Within the strength and stability  portion, allocate about 80% to strength and 20% to stability. In the cardio  portion, allocate about 80% to zone two training and 20% to VO2 max  specific training. Following this formula will provide the best way to train  for optimal health benefits.  ðŸ“š Transcript  Speaker 1  What do you recommend for your typical individual in a given week so I  usually start with the question of how much time are you willing to give  to this process you know people always say Well Peter what do you do  and it's like that's not that's not relevant what I do right tell me what  you're willing to do and we will we will work with that and by the way the  math is pretty much The same for everybody it's take whatever that  number is divided in half half of that is going to be strength and stability  half of that is going to be cardio the strength stability should Be divided  such that about 80 percent of it is strength 20 percent of its stability the  cardio should be divided such that about 80 percent of it is zone two  and 20 percent of it is VO2 max Specific training that in a nutshell is the  simplest formula for how to divide your time in exercise and is that going  to get you the fastest marathon time no is that going to help you win The  local time trial series if you're a cyclist no not at all right like so I'm not  for a second suggesting that this is the most sport specific way to train I'm telling you this is the best Way to train if you're trying to become a  centenary into catholic
