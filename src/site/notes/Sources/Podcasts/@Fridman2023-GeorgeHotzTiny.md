> The code base for a product can grow over time, leading to issues with different designs and unnecessary lines of code. Developers are often incentivized to add code, similar to politicians who add laws to move up in their respective fields. To address this problem, the solution is to simplify, simplify, simplify. Refactoring is necessary to improve a product, even if it takes time and requires a significant amount of refactors.
