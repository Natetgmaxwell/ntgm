> lot of people don't think well on the spot. So having these group meetings where everybody's required to contribute, a lot of people mull it over. They go for a walk after or they're walking home after work that night and then they get this idea of this spark and they're like, no, I don't see it that way. And then they can't contribute at that point. So you've tied one hand behind your back in terms of maximizing the talent on your team to figure out what the problem is and then to solve it. And so it makes a lot more sense to be like, hey, we're going to have a 30 minute meeting here and a 30 minute meeting here instead of one 60 minute meeting. And these meetings are going to be highly structured. And we're just going to talk about what the problem is. Can we agree on what the problem is? What do you see as the problem? What do you see into this lens that I don't see? Because I am not you. I can't see it. That's a way also to get out of this. I don't know. People like to posture in meetings. It drives me crazy. They basically repeat the executive summary in their own words and meetings go nowhere. And so a good way to avoid that is just to assume that everybody has read the required material and ask them what their unique contribution to this problem is that they don't think anybody else sees. And so now instead of rewarding just airtime, now you're rewarding unique contribution to the problem. And you get social signal out of having unique lens into the problem, which is much more effective.
