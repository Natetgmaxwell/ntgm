> if you act the way you act at the beginning, there would never be an end of the relationship because both people would be on their absolute best behavior, Giving to each other all the time. And the version of this that I try to like make as a practice or a habit is to have honey, I'm home energy. So honey, I'm home energy is like, if you ever see, and I love Lucy back in the day, the guy opens the door. He's bursting with energy like nobody comes home from work like that. But this guy did it in the show because it was a show. You come home, honey, I'm home. And you could just hear from the voice. If somebody's in the house, oh, get ready, it's on, like get ready for a great ball of energy coming your way. That is going to be loving. That is going to be affectionate. It's going to be playful and flirtation is a charming. All the things we kind of want to be. But we, we slip and we don't do it. And so one simple practice to develop the skill of enthusiasm is to have this honey. I'm home energy, which is before you walk through a door, whether it's to a meeting, whether it's to your house, your apartment, whatever it is, just decide to walk in with that honey, I'm home energy. And you only need to do it for like 45 seconds. But if you just do that for 45 seconds, you'll like the way it feels. They will respond to you differently. And it'll just carry versus if you come in slumped over, you're going to have that type of energy and that type of interaction and those types of experiences, which nobody actually wants To have.
