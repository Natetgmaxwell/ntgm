> Speaker 1 I put out a new theory about why women support body positivity so much or at least a contributing element to it. So I'm going to try and dance through this minefield here. I do think that there's some there there, but upfront, it's only a potential theory. So just hear me out. It's also not a comment on anyone as a person. So this is the rivalry theory of body positivity. Female support for body positivity is at least in part fueled deep down by female intersectional competition, which pushes women out of the dating pool by discouraging them from losing Weight. So Bill Burr on one of his Netflix specials where he did it outdoors at Red Rocks, I think said, quote, you guys are so into destroying each other. I see all that sneaky shit you do. Ladies, if you could just support the WNBA, the way you support a fat check who's proud of her body and no longer a threat to you, that league would be doing better numbers than the NBA. Oh my God, you're a goddess, you're gorgeous. You look great in that bikini. I'd kill myself if I looked like that. Keep eating, keep eating, lose a toe, you fat bitch. It's like if you saw an alcoholic, oh my God, your face down passed out, your kids are crying. You're a hero. You're a God. Keep doing what you're doing. So that really got me thinking as like that's ruthless, but really, really smart. And then there was this new study that just came out a couple of weeks ago in the Journal of Personality and Individual Differences that kind of put a little bit more legitimacy to this Idea than just like some comedians two minute segment. So they found that women who are high in interesexual competitiveness are more likely to advise women who they perceive as potential mating threats to cut off more hair, potentially In an attempt to sabotage their attractiveness. The researchers studied 450 women who are presented with hypothetical salon clients. Participants were asked to cut off the amount of hair to recommend the amount of hair to be cut off for each client. Women who reported higher levels of interesexual competitiveness were more likely to recommend that clients have more hair cut off when the hair was in good condition and clients Expressed a preference for minimal cutting. And the reason behind this recommendation might be to subtly manipulate the appearance of their rivals, right? Because longer hair is a cue to youth and health. By advising more extensive haircuts, these women could potentially diminish the physical attractiveness of other women. And another finding is that women advise clients of similar attractiveness as #702 î‚ˆ 16 Lessons From 700 Episodes  5 themselves to cut off the most hair. So in this scenario, participants effectively targeted women they perceived as being on the same attractiveness level as them, which suggests a form of competitive behavior called Horizontal competition when individuals compete with others of similar attributes or qualities. So the choice to focus on women of similar attractiveness may be strategic. High attractive individuals may not pose a significant mating threat to others because they likely already have access to high quality mates. On the other hand, targeting less attractive individuals might not yield the desired results as their physical appearance might not be easily harmed through hairstyle changes, Right? Okay, so why do I think that this relates to the body positivity movement? Because as far as I can tell, the parallels seem pretty obvious. Plus, you get social renown for standing up for a mistreated group. And importantly, there's no body positivity movement for men, right? If a guy is unhappy with his body, either publicly or privately, most guys won't say something along the lines of, you know, you're absolutely gorgeous as you are. You shouldn't feel any discomfort between where you are and where you want to get to. And women, the justification for this from an Eve's psych perspective is that women use [[Cards/Indirect Aggression\|Indirect Aggression]] way more than men do. So men's intra sexual competition is more like a large sledgehammer, whereas women's is like a poisoned arrow that you never see coming. And I'm not saying that this is the entirety of the justification for female support for body positivity. But I think it would be naive to say that it doesn't contribute at all, right? Now, I imagine that this is going to be an unpopular idea because it's uncomfortable to realize that what we thought were altruistic compulsions might have a selfish undercurrent. But intra sexual competition is a hell of a motivator. And it's just an idea. But I do think that there is something here to do with this. And if I make it through the next couple of weeks, then I'll be fine.
