> “People Are Surprisingly Hesitant to Reach Out to Old Friends,” reports  study results from more than 2,000 participants. More than 90 percent  of the subjects said they’d lost touch with an old friend, but the  majority of these subjects also said they felt neutral or negative about  reaching out to them. Oddly, people reported being as willing to speak  with a complete stranger or pick up garbage as they are to contact an  old friend.

> One lesson here is preventive — don’t let your friends become  strangers. The more time that passes between conversations, the  more they become an unfamiliar person.

> “Unfortunately,  few people nowadays are able to maintain friendships into adulthood.  We are too mobile, too specialized and narrow in our professional  interests to cultivate enduring relationships. . . . It is a constant surprise  to hear successful adults, especially men — managers of large  companies, brilliant lawyers and doctors — speak about how isolated  and lonely their lives have become.”

> A widely cited study found that it takes about 50  hours of socializing to go from acquaintance to casual friendship and a  total of 200 hours to become close friends. This underscores just how  wasteful it is to let our friendships decay. It’s unwise to discard these  investments or be reluctant to recover them, especially when the cost  is a simple message and conversation every now and then.
