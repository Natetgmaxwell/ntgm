> Maslow wrote in his book, The Farther Reaches of Human Nature:  We fear our highest possibilities.  We are generally afraid to become that which we can glimpse in our  most perfect moments, under the most perfect conditions, under  conditions of great courage.  We enjoy and even thrill to the godlike possibilities we see in  ourselves in such peak moments. And yet we simultaneously shiver  with weakness, awe, and fear before these very same possibilities.  So often, we run away from the responsibilities dictated, or rather  suggested by nature, by fate, even sometimes by accident, just as  Jonah tried in vain to run away from his fate.
