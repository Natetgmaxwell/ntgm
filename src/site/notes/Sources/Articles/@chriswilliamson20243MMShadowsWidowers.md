> You’re dating someone and they haven’t seen you for a week. You ask what they’re doing tonight and they tell you they’re hanging out with some of their friends. What you WANT to say is “I really would like to see you soon, it makes me worried when you spend time with your friends but not me that it’s because you don’t want to be with me.” What you ACTUALLY say is “Oh must be a very important night to see your friends again this week is it? Glad to see you’ve got so much spare time to catch up with them.” You’re out for dinner and your partner is on their phone a lot. What you WANT to say is “Hey I’d love to speak and I know you’re busy but it makes me feel really good when you focus on me during dinner, can your phone stuff wait until later?” What you ACTUALLY say is “That’s a very important message to be taking at this time? It’s gotta be really urgent.” Shadow sentences are not stating what you want or need, but instead saying a thing you hope will cause the other person to realise what you need, and then getting upset if they don’t. You kind of gesture in the direction of the thing you want without asking for it directly. It prevents you from having to be open and vulnerable when it feels like someone else has done something slightly wrong. It protects you from rejection by not actually asking for anything. It’s the ultimate expression of “if you loved me, you’d know what’s wrong”.
