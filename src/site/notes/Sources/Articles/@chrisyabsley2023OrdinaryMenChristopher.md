> Interesting here how language is used. [[Cards/Adolf Hitler\|Hitler]] uses the word 'pacify' (a word with peaceful connotations) to justify murderous actions. It reminds me of a famous George Orwell quote - "political language is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable".

> Unsurprisingly, sadism is a common theme throughout this book. It's almost a bottomless pit, whereby you think you have read the worst of it, and then you turn the page only to discover that you were wrong. It was not uncommon for me to read a paragraph of this book and wince.

> A striking revelation of this book was the personal nature at which members of the German police battalion knew their victims. Shooters were often paired off "face to face" with their victims.
