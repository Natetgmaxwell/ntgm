> Think of the science-backed method as the ultimate power nap - a power nap that skips the sleep part, entering your body into a state of rest and giving you an energy and endorphin boost equivalent to a good few hours of shut-eye.

> Just like sleep meditation, NSDR promises to help you master "the state you experience just before sleeping, where you're completely relaxed but semi-aware about what is happening around you," explains Dr Smriti Joshi, chief psychologist at Wysa.

> As above, NSDR - short for No Sleep Deep Rest - is a therapeutic practice developed and coined by Stanford University neuroscientist Andrew Huberman. "It's an umbrella term for many practices that can help individuals attain a state of calm and improved attention," explains Dr Joshi.

> The main goal of practicing NSDR - aside from boosting relaxation, focus, and mental clarity? "It's slowing down your body and brain to reach a brain frequency like the one you experience during the deep sleep phase," says Dr Joshi.

> "This relaxation is hugely beneficial," explains Dr Varsani. "When your mind stops and your body slows down, your body goes into a deeply restful state that helps manage stress, worry, and anxiety. During this phase of non-sleep deep rest, the body can focus its energy on bringing clarity to the mind, consolidating learning and memory and even repairing tissues and physical health,"

> Below, Dr Varsani shares a step-by-step guide on how to practice NSDR from anywhere. 1. Find somewhere quiet where you won't be disturbed and put your phone on do not disturb. Then, lay down or sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. 2. Taking slow, deep breaths, focus on relaxing each part of your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. 3. It can help to listen to a guided meditation or relaxing music - ideally, you want to maintain this relaxed state for ten to 30 minutes. 4. Once your guided meditation or time is up, gently bring back awareness to your surroundings and slowly open your eyes.

> Good question. If the science is anything to go by, it certainly can - one study published in the journal Sleep Vigil last year found that NSDR not only lowers stress levels, but boosts mood and cognitive performance, too. "One of the key physiological changes is a decrease in your "fight or flight response" - it reduces the activity in your sympathetic nervous system," explains psychologist Dr Varsani. "At the same time, there is an increase in activity in the parasympathetic nervous system - the part of the nervous system that helps you rest and reset."
