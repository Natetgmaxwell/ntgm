> Skeletal muscle is composed of 2 kinds of muscle fibers- [[Cards/Slow Twitch Fibres\|Type I]], also known as slow twitch, and Type II, or fast twitch. Fast twitch fibers are also divided in two subgroups called [[Cards/Fast-Twitch Oxidative Fibers\|Type IIa]] and IIb. Muscle fiber contraction obeys a sequential recruitment pattern where [[Cards/Slow Twitch Fibres\|Type I]] muscle fibers are the first ones to be recruited. As exercise intensity increases muscle contractile demands increase and [[Cards/Slow Twitch Fibres\|Type I]] muscle fibers cannot sustain the necessary demand. [[Cards/Fast-Twitch Oxidative Fibers\|Type IIa]] muscle fibers kick in and eventually as intensity keeps increasing [[Cards/Fast-Twitch Glycolytic Fibers\|Type IIb]] will finally be recruited. Simply put, slow twitch fibers are used at slower speeds and fast twitch at faster speeds.

> In this training zone we stimulate Type 1 muscle fibers, therefore we stimulate mitochondrial growth and function which will improve the ability to utilize fat. This is key in athletic performance as by improving fat utilization we preserve glycogen utilization throughout the entire competition

> An endurance athlete should never stop training in zone 2. The ideal training plan should include 3-4 days a week of zone 2 training in the first 2-3 months of preseason training, followed by 2-3 days a week as the season gets closer and 2 days of maintenance once the season is in full blown.
