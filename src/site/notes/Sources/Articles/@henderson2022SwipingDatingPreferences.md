> If you are a typical male in a relationship, don’t just do what comes naturally. Which is probably nothing, or close to nothing. You have to battle your own nature and go out of your way to pretend to be a decent and caring human being. This might not come naturally. But you’ll feel better if you do it, because you’re making your romantic partner feel better.

> In Suicide: The Social Causes of Self-Destruction, the sociologist Jason Manning reports that people who lose their jobs are more likely to kill themselves in the subsequent year than those who have not lost their jobs.

> Interestingly, conservatives are less willing than liberals to date someone with “extreme” views, even if they are on the same side of the political spectrum. 45% of liberals say they would be willing to date someone who was “extremely liberal,” while only 26% of conservatives would date someone who was “extremely conservative.” Liberals are more open to dating extremists than conservatives.

> One classic study found that consumers were more likely to buy a jam when they were presented with six flavors compared to 30. And among those who did make a purchase, the people presented with fewer flavors were more satisfied with their choice. When presented with a lot of options people are struck by uncertainty, constantly wondering “Did I make the right choice? Is this really the best I can do?”
