> [[Cards/Venipuncture\|Venipuncture]] can be performed by three basic methods: – Evacuated tube system (ETS) • Most preferred because blood is collected directly from the vein in the tube, minimizing the risk of specimen contamination and exposure to the blood. – Needle and syringe • Used on small, fragile and damaged veins. – Winged infusion set (butterfly) • Can be used with the ETS and syringe. • Used to draw blood from infants and children, hand veins and other difficult draw situations.
