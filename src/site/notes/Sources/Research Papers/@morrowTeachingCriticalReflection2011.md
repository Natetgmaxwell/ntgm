> Despite long-standing commitment to the notion of critical reflection across the healthcare professions it is unusual for critical theory and practice to be taught as explicit subjects in healthcare higher education. There is evidence to show that reflective techniques such as critical portfolios and reflective diaries can help students to consolidate and assess their learning of a discipline and its practices. Yet, there are also known drawbacks of critical reflection, including over self-critical inspection and the infinite regress of reflection on action. This paper offers a theoretically informed model of critical reflection which encompasses different purposes (thinking, learning and assessment of self and social systems), together with different forms of reflection (personal, interpersonal, contextual and critical). Explicitly teaching critical reflection is a logical step towards students being able to recognise and negotiate complex ethical and professional issues. However, teaching critical reflection creates challenges for curricula design, assessment and professional development.

> One known drawback of using reflective techniques is that critical reflectors can slide into self-conscious cynicism, isolated thinking and self-absorption (Boud and Walker 1998; Weick 1999; Alvesson and Sköldberg 2000; Lewis 2000; Finlay 2002).

> this could mean students who are reflecting on their own work become inward looking and allow self-inspection to dominate the work itself (Schön 1996). Baker (1990) argues that excessive rhetorical awareness can become “a house of mirrors” which can isolate individuals from the rest of the world or lead to disengagement in a process which students are not interested in.

> Teaching critical reflection supports the well-established argument that learning should include both the assimilation of subject knowledge and the confidence to question and adapt that knowledge (Barnett 1994). Simply teaching subject-knowledge falls short of ensuring new practitioners are empowered to question, and potentially improve upon, what they are doing or why they are doing it (Clegg 1999).
