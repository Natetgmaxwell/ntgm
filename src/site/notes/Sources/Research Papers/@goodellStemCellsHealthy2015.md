> Research into stem cells and aging aims to understand how stem cells maintain tissue health, what mechanisms ultimately lead to decline in stem cell function with age, and how the regenerative capacity of somatic stem cells can be enhanced to promote healthy aging. Here, we explore the effects of aging on stem cells in different tissues. Recent research has focused on the ways that genetic mutations, epigenetic changes, and the extrinsic environmental milieu influence stem cell functionality over time. We describe each of these three factors, the ways in which they interact, and how these interactions decrease stem cell health over time. We are optimistic that a better understanding of these changes will uncover potential strategies to enhance stem cell function and increase tissue resiliency into old age.

> One of the central features of protected aging is prolonged survival beyond the ages of peak reproductive fitness (Fig. 1). The fact that individual members of any species rarely live beyond this stage in the wild means that there would have been no evolutionary pressure to select for genetic mechanisms to assure maintenance of somatic tissues into old age.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and intestinal stem cells (ISCs) do both, contributing to ongoing production of differentiated cells and also repairing tissue after injury.

> With these views, what strategies or interventions can be envisioned to extend healthspan by targeting stem cells? Two approaches emerge naturally from the studies discussed. First, it seems as if the phenotypes of aging stem cells may be at least partially reversible. As noted above, heterochronic parabiosis studies suggest that factors in young blood might partially ameliorate the functional deficits of aged stem cells (30, 31). Furthermore, the injection of plasma from young mice into the circulation of aged mice has recently been shown to induce a more youthful state of cells in the brain of the old animal (32). These findings indicate that at least some aspects of cellular aging may be reversible, perhaps through reprogramming of the epigenome (49). Indeed, interventions that clearly extend organismal life span even when applied late in life, such as rapamycin treatment (50), may enhance stem cell function in aged animals. As such, it may be that treatments that directly enhance the function of aged stem cells do so by acting on the epigenome to adopt a more youthful state.
