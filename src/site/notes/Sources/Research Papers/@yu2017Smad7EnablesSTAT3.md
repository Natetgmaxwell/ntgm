> TGF-β and related growth factors critically regulate cell potency and functions. Smad7 is induced by TGF-βs and inhibits the physiological functions of TGF-β signaling. This study describes an unexpected finding that Smad7 promotes self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in a manner independent of its inhibition on TGF-β signaling. Instead, Smad7 acts to induce activation of transcription factor signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) in ESCs. Smad7 activates STAT3 through its direct binding to the cytokine receptor upstream of STAT3 activation. In agreement with the role of STAT3 in maintaining ESC pluripotency, Smad7 promotes ESC self-renewal and induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming. This finding illustrates a regulatory mechanism for Smad7 in maintaining pluripotency, and likely in cancer and inflammation., Smad7 is a negative feedback product of TGF-β superfamily signaling and fine tunes a plethora of pleiotropic responses induced by TGF-β ligands. However, its noncanonical functions independent of TGF-β signaling remain to be elucidated. Here, we show that Smad7 activates signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in maintaining mouse embryonic stem cell pluripotency in a manner independent of the TGF-β receptors, yet dependent on the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) coreceptor glycoprotein 130 (gp130). Smad7 directly binds to the intracellular domain of gp130 and disrupts the SHP2–gp130 or SOCS3–gp130 complex, thereby amplifying STAT3 activation. Consequently, Smad7 facilitates LIF-mediated self-renewal of mouse ESCs and is also critical for induced pluripotent stem cell reprogramming. This finding illustrates an uncovered role of the Smad7–STAT3 interplay in maintaining cell pluripotency and also implicates a mechanism involving Smad7 underlying cytokine-dependent regulation of cancer and inflammation.

> It is generally thought that the primary function of Smad7 is to negatively impact TGF-β/BMP signaling. However, Smad7 actions outside of the TGF-β/BMP signaling have rarely been explored. A previous study reported that Smad7 is highly expressed in undifferentiated ESCs (41).

> Therefore, in addition to its well-established role in blocking canonical TGF-β–Smad signaling via binding to the TGF-β/BMP type I receptor, Smad7 can exert its cellular function through direct binding to a cytokine receptor and enhancement of downstream STAT3 signaling. Because the interplay between TGF-β and gp130–STAT3 signaling exists in various physiological contexts, it is conceivable that through its interaction with the gp130–STAT3 axis, Smad7 may have a broader role in bridging the collaborative functions of the TGF-β–Smad and gp130–STAT3 signaling pathways in other pathophysiological processes such as inflammation and tumorigenesis.
