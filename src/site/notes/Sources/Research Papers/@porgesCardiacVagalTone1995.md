> Cardiac vagal tone is proposed as a novel index of stress and stress vulnerability in mammals. A model is described that emphasizes the role of the parasympathetic nervous system and particularly the vagus nerve in defining stress. The model details the importance of a branch of the vagus originating in the nucleus ambiguus. In mammals the nucleus ambiguus not only coordinates sucking, swallowing, and breathing, but it also regulates heart rate and vocalizations in response to stressors. In mammals it is possible, by quantifying the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, to assess the tonic and phasic regulation of the vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus. Measurement of this component of vagal tone is proposed as a method to assess, on an individual basis, both stress and the vulnerability to stress.
