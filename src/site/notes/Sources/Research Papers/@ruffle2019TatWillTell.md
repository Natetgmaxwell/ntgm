> Survey and experimental evidence documents discrimination against tattooed individuals in the labor market and in commercial transactions. Thus, individuals’ decision to get tattooed may reflect short-sighted time preferences. We show that, according to numerous measures, those with [[Cards/Tattoos\|tattoos]], especially visible ones, are more short-sighted and [[Cards/Impulsivity\|impulsive]] than the non-tattooed. Almost nothing mitigates these results, neither the motive for the tattoo, the time contemplated before getting tattooed nor the time elapsed since the last tattoo. Even the expressed intention to get a(nother) tattoo predicts increased short-sightedness and helps establish the direction of causality between [[Cards/Tattoos\|tattoos]] and short-sightedness.

> Indeed, whether based on the belief that the tattooed are less qualified (statistical discrimination) or are simply not liked (taste-based 1 discrimination) ample evidence points to discrimination against the tattooed in the workplace and in commerce.
