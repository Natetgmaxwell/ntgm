> [!Abstract]  
> Endogenous pathologic [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|hypercortisolism]], or [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|Cushing’s Syndrome]], is associated with poor quality of life, morbidity and increased mortality. Early diagnosis may mitigate against this natural history of the disorder., The clinical presentation of [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|Cushing’s Syndrome]] varies, in part related to the extent and duration of [[Cards/Cortisol\|cortisol]] excess. When [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|hypercortisolism]] is severe, its signs and symptoms are unmistakable. However, most of the signs and symptoms of [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|Cushing’s Syndrome]] are common in the general population (e.g. hypertension and weight gain) and not all are present in every patient., In addition to classical features of glucocorticoid excess, such as proximal muscle weakness and wide purple striae, patients may present with the associated co-morbidities that are caused by [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|hypercortisolism]]. These include cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disease, psychiatric and cognitive deficits, and infections. As a result, internists and generalists must consider [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|Cushing’s Syndrome]] as a cause, and endocrinologists should search for and treat these co-morbidities., Recommended tests to screen for [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|Cushing’s Syndrome]] include 1 mg dexamethasone suppression, urine free [[Cards/Cortisol\|cortisol]] and late night salivary [[Cards/Cortisol\|cortisol]]. These may be slightly elevated in patients with physiologic [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|hypercortisolism]], which should be excluded, along with exogenous glucocorticoid use. Each screening test has caveats and the choice of tests should be individualized based on each patient’s characteristics and lifestyle., The objective of this review was to update the readership on the clinical and biochemical features of [[Cards/Cushing’s Syndrome\|Cushing’s Syndrome]] that are useful when evaluating patients for this diagnosis.
