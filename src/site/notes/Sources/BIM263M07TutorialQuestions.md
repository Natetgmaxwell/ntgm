> Low molecular weight heparin is an advantageous as it has an extended half-lift compared to regular heparin. Also has reduced side effects including decreased platelet count.

> Warfarin acts by inhibiting an essential enzyme that activates vitamin K in the body, depleting vitamin K supply in the body. This vitamin K is a co-factor for k-dependant clotting factors.

> Statins are a completive inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase, which normally converts acetyl coA into melvonic acid in the cholestrol synthesis pathway. Therefore increasing the expression of LDL recpeptors on the liver.

> COX-2 involved in the production of prostaglandins (PGE2, PGD2) which initially promote a pro-inflammatory response, but will resolve via a pro-resolution pathway. However the absence of COX-2 activity, prostoglandins will still be produced, initiating the inflammatory response, but this cannot be resolved.
