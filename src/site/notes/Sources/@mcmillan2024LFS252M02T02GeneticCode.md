## Transcript

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
In the first module today, we're going to take a look

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,800
at the genetic code and the genetic analysis of mutations.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,720
So we're going to be teaching about transcription,

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:15,800
about translation, and about the genetic analysis

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,280
of mutations.

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:21,500
From lectures already in this course,

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,600
you'd understand what the structure of DNA looks like.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,680
So DNA is a double-stranded molecule.

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,160
We've got one strand shown in blue on the left-hand side,

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,860
another strand shown in red on the right-hand side.

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:45,120
The individual nucleotides of a single-stranded DNA molecule

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,280
are joined together through a backbone,

13
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,720
and that backbone consists of the ribose

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,320
from one nucleotide and the phosphate of that nucleotide,

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,200
joined up to the ribose and the phosphate

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,240
of the next nucleotide in the chain.

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,500
It's the basis here shown in the middle,

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,500
which defines what nucleotide forms part of the chain.

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,020
And if you look closely, you can see these aromatic cycles

20
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,380
or rings look a little bit different.

21
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,380
While we're here, it's worthwhile noting as well

22
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,380
the bonding that occurs between one DNA strand and another.

23
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,160
This bonding is not covalent,

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,240
it's non-covalent hydrogen bonding.

25
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,680
If you look at the bonding between a C and a G,

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,660
we have three bonds, one, two, three,

27
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:44,700
but the bonding between an adenine and the thiamine,

28
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,940
there's only two hydrogen bonds.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,020
So one thing that this means is if you actually

30
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,420
want to dissociate these two DNA molecules,

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,420
You need more energy to disrupt a bond between

32
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,540
a cytin and a guanine than you do for a bond

33
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,180
between an ananine and a cymine.

34
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:11,500
If you remember what DNA is for and some things

35
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,120
that DNA does inside a cell, they're summarised here

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,060
and you covered this briefly last week.

37
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,180
And really today's video is all about

38
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,100
expanding on that knowledge.

39
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,180
So we have a DNA molecule here.

40
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,380
One thing we might want to do

41
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,300
is replicate that DNA molecule.

42
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,420
So if your cell's going to divide,

43
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,700
we need the DNA to divide as well.

44
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,740
The other thing that DNA is going to do

45
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,820
is act as the instructions

46
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,300
for the making of proteins in a cell.

47
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,420
And what happened is a DNA molecule

48
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,300
encodes for an RNA molecule that's shown here.

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,500
So the process by which we convert DNA to RNA

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,320
is called transcription.

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:03,460
That RNA molecule is then going to be used as the basis

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,340
to form our proteins.

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,820
The important thing here is you can think of DNA

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,420
as the computer code.

55
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,420
It contains the instructions on how to make proteins,

56
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,560
what the specific sequence of those proteins are.

57
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,560
your RNA is an intermediate step between these two things.

58
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,040
So remember DNA has the instructions,

59
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,360
our protein has the function.

60
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:38,960
In eukaryotic cells, our DNA lives inside the nucleus,

61
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:43,560
it's converted to RNA in the nucleus as well.

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,840
However, the RNA is going to leave the nucleus

63
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,240
and it's in the cytosol that we're going to see

64
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,240
translation of mRNA into protein.

65
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,680
In bacteria which don't have organelles,

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,760
all this happens in the cytoplasm of the cell.

67
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,960
Let's start with transcription.

68
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,740
So transcription is simply the production

69
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,500
of an RNA copy of a DNA molecule.

70
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,620
Have a think about this though.

71
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,640
For humans, there's three billion bases.

72
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,240
We have about 3,000 also genes.

73
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,760
Where would transcription start?

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,280
Are we going to convert all of a chromosome

75
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,340
into a single RNA molecule?

76
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,640
The answer's no.

77
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,380
In fact, we're going to be, what happens in biology

78
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,840
is that we get single genes being converted

79
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,840
into proteins in eukaryotes, and in prokaryotes,

80
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,600
we can get a couple of genes that form part of a thin-carbon

81
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,720
operon being converted into mRNA at one time,

82
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,900
and they get converted then into the protein.

83
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:03,400
So what that means is that we need a start site.

84
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,840
So when we're going to make some mRNA,

85
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,440
we need somewhere for that to start being made from.

86
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,500
And in molecular biology,

87
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,760
that start site is going to be here.

88
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,020
So it's the transcription start sites plus one.

89
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:25,540
This transcription start site lives upstream of the gene

90
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,780
that we're interested in,

91
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,400
the one we want to be converted into mRNA and protein.

92
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,260
You'll see there's a little bit of mRNA here,

93
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,460
I'll show you a little bit of nucleotide sequence

94
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,520
that will be converted into RNA,

95
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,240
but will not be converted into protein.

96
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,360
If you look a little bit further at what we call upstream now,

97
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
we have this thing called a promoter.

98
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,840
Promoters are very important.

99
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,680
The protein that's going to convert our DNA into RNA,

100
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,520
or make RNA from DNA, is called RNA polymerase.

101
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,800
That RNA polymerase needs to know where to start.

102
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,440
The place that's going to start is a promoter sequence.

103
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,120
We'll talk a little bit more about these

104
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,400
on the next few slides.

105
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,240
One last thing about DNA at this point,

106
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,060
and that's some naming conventions.

107
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,440
So DNA has two strands, of course,

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,000
and they're shown here in green.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,600
We call one of those strands the template strand,

110
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,280
and the other strand the non-template strand.

111
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,300
They're also actually called non-coding and coding strands.

112
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,060
It's called a template strand because this is the piece

113
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,580
or the side of the DNA that's going to be copied.

114
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:53,020
But when it's copied, it's not gonna make a direct copy,

115
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,940
it's actually gonna make the complementary sequence.

116
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:07,540
That complementary sequence, of course,

117
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:10,460
now is a little bit different in the fact

118
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:15,460
that we no longer have thiamines in this particular sequence.

119
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,140
RNA replaces the thiamines,

120
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,500
so here's a thiamine here, with a uracil.

121
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,020
So this RNA sequence down the bottom here,

122
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,240
called your primary RNA transcript,

123
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,140
is almost identical to the non-template strand,

124
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,340
with the only difference that the Ts are replaced with a U.

125
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:38,980
In the next few slides,

126
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,740
we're gonna take a close look at the steps in transcription.

127
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,700
We're going to break these steps down into three stages.

128
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,860
So the first is initiation,

129
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,860
the second is the elongation phase,

130
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,220
where we're actually going to make our RNA molecules.

131
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,940
And finally, we need a termination point.

132
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,680
So we need to stop making RNA somewhere.

133
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,060
The protein that's involved in making RNA

134
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,900
is called RNA polymerase.

135
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,420
There's a few different versions of RNA polymerase

136
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,500
in different organisms,

137
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,780
but they all have very similar functions.

138
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,960
And what you can see in this particular image

139
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,900
is we have some DNA here.

140
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:25,100
So RNA polymerase is going to take up and bind DNA,

141
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,500
and DNA is going to move

142
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,900
through the RNA polymerase active site.

143
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Along the way, that's gonna result in the formation

144
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,980
of our growing mRNA molecule.

145
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,780
This RNA polymerase has multiple subunits,

146
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,660
it's a very complicated molecule,

147
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,820
but we're just gonna go through the functional steps

148
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,540
of what it's doing in the next few slides.

149
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:58,020
So the first thing is initiation.

150
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,820
Now RNA polymerase needs to find a space

151
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,640
to bind to DNA upstream of a gene

152
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,400
that it's going to transcribe.

153
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,220
That RNA polymerase doesn't bind just anywhere on DNA,

154
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,100
it binds to specific nucleotide sequences.

155
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,120
And those nucleotide sequences have a name,

156
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,320
we call them promoters.

157
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,480
And you can find them upstream of genes

158
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,780
in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

159
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,380
As we'll see in a few slides,

160
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,800
there are some differences between

161
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,580
these two kinds of organisms,

162
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:37,200
but their general concept of how they function

163
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,620
is exactly the same.

164
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,460
So after binding to that promoter sequence,

165
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,060
what RNA polymerase is going to do

166
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,840
is actually going to unwind or melt the DNA.

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,860
It's going to result in disassociation

168
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,580
of about 10 to 12 base pairs of DNA.

169
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,460
This DNA that's been dissociated

170
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,580
is called a transcription bubble.

171
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,180
And the reason why we're going to do that

172
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,380
is because once this dissociation has happened,

173
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:14,620
it's gonna enable from this start point

174
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,340
the synthesis of our mRNA molecules.

175
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:21,140
And in fact, what's going to actually happen

176
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,940
is we're gonna have some RNTPs.

177
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,700
So these are our nucleotides

178
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,380
So they're gonna make up our RNA now.

179
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,860
A couple of those are going to come into the active site

180
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:36,820
and through the action of RNA polymerase,

181
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,780
start to be synthesized into an RNA molecule.

182
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:45,940
What our polymerase is doing is actually catalyzing

183
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:48,660
and joining the phosphodiester backbone

184
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,520
in those RNA molecules.

185
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,060
Once we have that initial step occurring,

186
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,880
that's going to move us onto the elongation phase.

187
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,220
So you can see now here RNA molecule that's being made.

188
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,100
What's happening is our RNA molecule, apologies,

189
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:19,100
our RNA polymerase is moving down our DNA molecule,

190
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,640
our double-stranded DNA molecule.

191
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,960
As it does this, it unwinds a little bit of that DNA.

192
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,400
So we have our bubble here.

193
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,840
While that DNA is unwound,

194
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,880
that enables the RNA polymerase

195
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,920
of the collective activity

196
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,920
that is adding nucleotides to a growing RNA chain to occur.

197
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,600
So RNA is being made.

198
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,320
And then as the RNA polymerase moves down,

199
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,080
the transcription bubble closes behind it.

200
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,680
So our RNA polymerase has two major functions, if you like.

201
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,160
It's opening up our DNA molecule.

202
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:01,880
It's enabling transcription of mRNA.

203
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,120
Then as it moves along,

204
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,080
we're seeing the closing of the formation

205
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,460
double stranded DNA again.

206
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:18,240
When does our RNA polymerase stop making RNA?

207
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,200
on this process is called termination.

208
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,760
And so when we have our gene,

209
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,640
now I'm just gonna draw some DNA for you.

210
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,540
So here's a bit of DNA.

211
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,000
We're going to draw our gene in the middle.

212
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,440
Up here is our promoter sequence,

213
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,700
gonna call that a P.

214
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:42,340
And our RNA polymerase binds here, heads this way.

215
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:45,420
Obviously there's gonna be a point

216
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,200
where our RNA polymerase has transcribed

217
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,600
all the DNA into RNA needed to make a particular protein.

218
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,480
At this point, our RNA polymerase needs to fall off.

219
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,480
And that point is called a termination signal

220
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,680
or a termination site.

221
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,840
There's some specific details about those sites

222
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,680
that we don't need to go into,

223
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,560
but just like promoter sequences,

224
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,320
these are specific nucleotide sequences as well.

225
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,280
And at the end of this process,

226
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,420
and we're going to have an RNA molecule,

227
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:22,420
which encompasses the RNA that's gonna form our protein,

228
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,540
but we also have now a little bit of RNA

229
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,300
sitting on either end that's not going to be turned

230
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,520
into our final protein product.

231
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,620
This is a good time to remind you

232
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,220
that the mRNA molecule that's made

233
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,440
is not identical to the DNA template strand

234
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,860
that it's copied from.

235
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,940
it's in fact what we call the reverse complement

236
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,620
of that strand.

237
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,580
So where your RNA polymerase is involved in

238
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,460
forming the phosphodiester bonds

239
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,960
between different nucleotides,

240
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,140
it's the actual nucleotide sequence in the DNA strand

241
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,920
which governs what nucleotide is added to the growing strand.

242
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,420
And it uses normal base hybridization for this to occur.

243
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,360
So if our DNA strand has a thymine,

244
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,040
that's gonna result in the incorporation of adenine

245
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,660
into our growing mRNA molecule.

246
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,600
If our DNA strand has an adenine,

247
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,260
that's gonna result in RNA and a uracil being added.

248
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:32,860
Again, remember that RNA has uracils and not thiamine.

249
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,840
And this way, we're gonna have our growing mRNA strand

250
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,040
being made, which is the reverse complement

251
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,280
of our DNA template strand.

252
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,900
That's also why it's the same,

253
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,780
apart from uracils of our non-template DNA strand.

254
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,880
So, maybe we have a look at this sequence

255
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,280
and this sequence.

256
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,700
They're virtually identical,

257
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:01,380
except for the substitution of thymines with uracels.

258
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:08,180
There are some differences in how mRNA is transcribed

259
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,980
and organized between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

260
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,620
Let's take a look at our prokaryotes first of all.

261
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:35,500
Here's the genome of Ischryst

262
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,820
of tryptophan operon.

263
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,400
This operon is involved in the synthesis of tryptophan

264
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,500
and tryptophan is an amino acid needed by E. coli.

265
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:52,180
To make tryptophan, we require five actual proteins

266
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,560
and they perform different roles

267
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,280
in their production of tryptophan.

268
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:00,500
There's not much point producing one of these proteins

269
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,060
without producing the rest.

270
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:05,180
So one thing that bacteria do then

271
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,780
is they can produce multiple genes

272
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,620
in a single mRNA transcript.

273
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,840
We call this an operon.

274
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,380
So this is the tryptophan synthesis operon.

275
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:20,540
So in transcription,

276
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,700
we're going to have all this DNA transcribed

277
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,540
as one molecule into this mRNA molecule

278
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,540
shown in purple down the bottom.

279
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,780
When it comes time to then make proteins,

280
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:40,500
mRNA molecule. That can happen at different sites shown in green here.

281
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,900
That's how we get different proteins from the tryptophan operon being

282
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:56,580
produced as from one mRNA transcript. Compare this now to eukaryotes. In

283
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,780
and eukaryotes, one transcript,

284
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:04,780
generally encodes for one protein only.

285
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:08,820
So here's some more tryptophan synthesis genes.

286
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,140
They're found at different parts in the yeast chromosome

287
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,020
and even on proctan different chromosomes.

288
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,160
So they're transcribed independently

289
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,720
and then translated independently.

290
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,380
So again, in bacteria, you can have multiple genes

291
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,600
are one mRNA transcript,

292
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:32,000
and eukaryotes, you only have one gene,

293
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,540
are one mRNA transcript.

294
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:41,160
Eukaryotic RNA differs from prokaryotic RNA

295
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,560
in another important way as well.

296
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,440
And that's the fact that it has some additional sequences

297
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,640
in it that aren't actually going to be used

298
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,560
to make the final protein.

299
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,020
So let's have a look at those now.

300
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,260
So the first thing is to look at the end here.

301
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:06,300
This particular green dot here is called an M7GPPP cap.

302
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:12,100
All that is for is to help to stabilize the mRNA molecule.

303
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:18,360
We're more interested in what's at the end here

304
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,980
and what's in the middle.

305
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,000
So all mRNA molecules from eukaryotes are made

306
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,800
with additional adenines added to the end of the transcript.

307
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,060
So we say that they have a poly A tail.

308
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:40,960
Remember prokaryotes do not have poly A tails.

309
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:47,240
One last thing that's really, really important

310
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,360
is that genes in eukaryotes are made up

311
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,360
of both exons and introns.

312
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,760
You can see at the top here,

313
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,500
our exons are this maroon color

314
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,840
and our introns are this blue color.

315
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,280
It's only our exons here,

316
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:09,640
which are gonna be used to make our final protein.

317
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,480
Our introns aren't going to be used

318
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,640
to make that final protein.

319
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,640
So somehow we need to remove those introns

320
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,900
from our final mRNA molecule.

321
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:23,800
And the process for that is called splicing.

322
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,980
We don't need to look at the mechanism here,

323
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,200
but we do need to understand that splicing out

324
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,440
of our introns results in our final mRNA molecule

325
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,800
that we can use for translation.

326
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:43,480
All this part of here is called mRNA processing.

327
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,540
And that gives us our final mRNA molecule down the bottom.

328
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:54,540
This particular example looks at the beta-globin gene.

329
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,580
So here's beta-globin genomic DNA,

330
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,140
and that results in our beta-globin mRNA.

331
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,260
Making RNA is only half the story.

332
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:10,020
We need to use that RNA to make proteins.

333
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,100
On the processor converting RNA into protein

334
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,180
is called translation.

335
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,340
Just as a reminder, what is happening during translation

336
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:26,120
is that we're taking individual amino acids

337
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,620
and we're going to link them together

338
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,520
to make our final protein that can be made

339
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,400
of many, many amino acids.

340
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:41,140
The way this occurs is we're going to make a covalent bond

341
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,380
between the carboxyl group of one amino acid

342
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,980
and the amino group of another amino acid.

343
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,700
When this reaction takes place,

344
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,980
we'll lose this hydroxyl group here,

345
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,540
all this is hydrogen group here,

346
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:01,620
and we're going to have this carbon nitrogen bond.

347
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,800
So this is a one amino acid here,

348
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,100
this is another amino acid there.

349
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:10,460
The place where this takes place

350
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,100
is in a protein complex called a ribosome.

351
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:20,100
So in this particular figure, the ribosome is shown in grey.

352
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:27,140
One of the features of the ribosome is that the mRNA

353
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,980
will enter the ribosome and travel through that ribosome.

354
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,540
And you can see the arrows here showing the movement

355
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,600
of the RNA molecule.

356
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,580
We can also see these other strange looking molecules

357
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,260
in here as well.

358
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,580
And these are called tRNA molecules.

359
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,600
So I'm blowing one up here on the right hand side

360
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,860
to show you it has a couple of features.

361
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,460
The two important ones at the top here,

362
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,100
this is actually your arabino acid,

363
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,860
the one that we wanna add to our growing protein chain.

364
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:05,120
And down the bottom here, this is called the anticodon.

365
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,420
It's called anticodon because of the opposite sequence

366
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,240
to our RNA molecule.

367
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,720
It's called a codon in the anticodon terminology

368
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,560
because there's three nucleotides

369
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,320
and these three nucleotides here

370
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,320
always specify a specific amino acid.

371
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,300
So if this codon is CAG,

372
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,720
that means it's only a one amino acid

373
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,680
attached to this end.

374
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Different molecules or different tRNAs

375
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,080
will have different anticodons.

376
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,000
You can see the picture here,

377
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,760
This one's got A, G, and a C,

378
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,760
and they reflect different amino acids.

379
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:54,640
So what happens in making a protein

380
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,160
is our mRNA molecule is going to enter our ribosome complex.

381
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,200
When it's in the complex,

382
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:08,120
tRNA molecules are going to enter the active site as well.

383
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,520
if that tRNA molecule is complementary to the RNA sequence,

384
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:19,640
that's gonna result in the addition of the minor acid

385
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,880
to our growing polypeptide chain.

386
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,940
So in the figure here now, we have two tRNA molecules.

387
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,400
We have one with a triple U anticodon

388
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,900
and one with the AGC anticodon.

389
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,120
They're held in place currently by some hydrogen bonding

390
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,760
between the anticodons and the mRNA sequences.

391
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:44,100
While that's occurring on the other part

392
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,960
of the active site of the ribosome,

393
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,940
we're having the creation of the bond

394
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,140
between the nitrogen and the carbon.

395
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,380
So this amino acid is going to be added

396
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:00,960
to this growing chain when that reaction is complete.

397
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,420
This anticodon and this part of the mRNA molecule

398
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:14,960
We'll leave the ribosome and the next tRNA molecule can enter.

399
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:22,300
So we can see the specificity here now is governed by these anticodons.

400
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,420
You might want to go back and compare that sequence of that codon to the DNA template

401
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
sequence.

402
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,420
So remember a tRNA anticodon matches up

403
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,920
with a specific amino acid.

404
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:42,640
By having these particular tRNAs inside the ribosome here,

405
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,260
that enables the bonding to occur between the nitrogen

406
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,720
and the carbon to form the peptide bond.

407
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:56,220
So we have 20 amino acids,

408
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,160
but those of you who are good with your mass

409
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,280
we'll understand that codons can theoretically result

410
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:05,560
in 64 different codons.

411
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:10,560
We have four RNA bases that can result in 64 codons.

412
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:17,360
What this actually means is that there are different

413
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,040
anticodons or multiple anticodons

414
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,800
coding for certain amino acids.

415
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,660
So let's take a look at how we can read this table

416
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,240
on the left-hand side.

417
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,540
Here on the left-hand side y-axis,

418
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,580
we have the first position of an anticode on.

419
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,780
On the top here, we have the second position.

420
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,160
And on the right, we have the third position.

421
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:49,780
So a codon that is U, U, G, for instance,

422
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,820
we're ready U here, we're ready U up here,

423
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,180
and then that third position we read down here,

424
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,260
make this a G, that codon encodes from leucine.

425
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,620
If it was U, U, A,

426
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,940
that would also encode from leucine.

427
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,840
However, if it was U, U,

428
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,180
U down the bottom, that encodes a valine.

429
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:22,780
So you can see here the fact that we have

430
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,980
multiple different codons encoding

431
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,980
for our amino acids is a concept that's called redundancy.

432
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,860
That is a different codon,

433
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,640
it's a code for specific amino acids.

434
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,440
Generally, the codon usage is consistent

435
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,280
across all organisms.

436
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,040
There are actually some different organisms

437
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,320
that actually use different codon usages.

438
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,480
What we mean by that is that in this case

439
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,000
where we can see this UUU,

440
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,060
for instance, in code to the alanine,

441
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,900
in different organisms,

442
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:02,900
you may in fact encode for a different amino acid.

443
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:07,420
But for 99% of organisms,

444
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:12,040
this codon usage table is universal.

445
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:22,820
Here are all the amino acids that we use.

446
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,740
There's 20 of them.

447
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:29,940
As we mentioned before, our Curdons can make

448
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,780
64 different Curdons based on the four bases.

449
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,140
So just keep in mind the way that we tend to actually

450
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:44,860
classify amino acids into different groups.

451
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,700
So at the top here,

452
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,060
these are our hydrophobic amino acids.

453
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,660
As the name suggests,

454
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:54,180
The R group here is hydrophobic.

455
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,780
It doesn't like water.

456
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:04,940
Our second group here, our hydrophilic amino acids,

457
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,100
and this can be broken down into some separate groups.

458
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,460
Our basic amino acids,

459
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:14,100
and also our polar amino acids with uncharged R groups.

460
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,580
These are water-loving molecules.

461
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,140
So these guys, if you have proteins with lots

462
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,780
So these amino acids, they'll dissolve quite easily in water.

463
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,860
These ones which are hydrophobic,

464
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,440
if you have lots of these amino acids in a protein,

465
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:34,680
these guys generally sit on the inside of a protein

466
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,500
where they can be sort of hiding away from water molecules.

467
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,820
Let's finish our discussion on translation

468
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:46,220
by looking at a few final points.

469
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:52,620
So here's our figure from earlier showing a protein being made on a ribosome.

470
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,420
And so you can see a tRNA molecule in the middle here.

471
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,120
It has the U, the U, the U down the bottom.

472
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,720
And that's attached to the amino acid at the top here,

473
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,920
which is going to be added to our growing chain.

474
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:12,920
The question here is, how do we know when we're making a protein

475
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,080
that we're going to use this triplet, AAA,

476
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,760
to match up with the UUU.

477
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,520
Couldn't we just as easily make a triplet from this GAA?

478
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,920
And then that will encode a completely different

479
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,280
amino acid.

480
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:33,480
So when we look at a DNA sequence,

481
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,480
we often talk about it in terms of open reading frames

482
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,400
when we're talking about proteins.

483
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,000
And you'll see how this matches up

484
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,320
to what I'm talking about over here in a second.

485
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,000
So let's have a look on the left-hand side.

486
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
We have a sequence, GCUUGUUUAG, CGAUU and AA.

487
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,760
If you look at the codons

488
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,600
and what they're in terms of amino acids,

489
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,960
you can see we've got alanine, cysteine, leucine, arginine

490
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,600
and isoleucine.

491
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,920
What happens if we read this in a slightly different way?

492
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,200
If you ignore this G at the front now,

493
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:14,560
and actually start from the C to make our triplets,

494
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,200
so we have C-U-U, G-U-U, and so on,

495
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,280
that actually results in other amino acid sequences

496
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,240
being derived from this particular sequence.

497
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,880
Again, we could actually do it through

498
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,160
the third open reading frame here.

499
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,400
We have another combination of amino acids again.

500
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:40,660
So what happens is we need a way for our DNA

501
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,180
to be converted into a protein sequence

502
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,520
in such a manner that it knows

503
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,760
which one of these open reading frames

504
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,440
is actually going to encode for the real protein.

505
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,080
Only one of these open reading frames

506
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,280
is the one that's going to be converted into a protein.

507
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,680
And so just for terminology's sake,

508
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,240
we call these open reading frames

509
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,320
frame one, frame two, and frame three.

510
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:16,320
So one way that actually works is that all open reading frames that are going to convert it into a protein need a common start codon.

511
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,320
That means the very first codon of a protein is always going to be the same.

512
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,320
And that start codon is AUG. That also encodes from the bionine.

513
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:37,800
That means at the start of very many proteins, the first amino acid is going to be methionine.

514
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:44,280
The mRNA molecule enters the ribosome and the ribosome scans along that mRNA molecule

515
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:50,680
and it's only when it comes across a start codon that it's going to integrate the first

516
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:57,840
tRNA and that's from the thionine and from that point the protein is started to be made.

517
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,360
In addition to making the protein though, we also need to stop making proteins.

518
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,820
Proteins have a specific length depending on what they are.

519
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:14,280
And what that means is that we also have codons that encode for stop codons.

520
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,880
There's actually three of those and you can see them here.

521
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:24,800
What happens at these sites is that as our ribosome is scanning along our mRNA

522
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:30,400
When it gets to a point where it tries to incorporate a triplet with a UAA

523
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,200
For instance that actually causes the ribosome to be bumped off the mRNA

524
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,400
And protein synthesis is stopped at that point

525
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,920
So all proteins

526
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,520
Need to start Curdon, which is my thionine

527
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,660
and I need to stop Curd-On.

528
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,200
If you go back, look at your Curd-On tables

529
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,460
from previous slides,

530
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,140
you'll see those actual Curd-Ons in that table as well.

531
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:04,600
Just scan these again to understand

532
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,060
what I'm talking about on this particular slide.

533
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,120
Let's try this in action.

534
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,320
Okay, so here's a piece of mRNA.

535
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:20,260
the sequence is UUA, AUG, GUA, UAA, and CAU.

536
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:29,220
In a cell, what is this sequence going to be translated as?

537
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,540
Let's make the assumption.

538
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,780
This is actually in the frame,

539
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,780
so we don't need to worry about those open reading frames.

540
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,240
Just ask yourself what will be the protein sequence

541
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,780
associated with this mRNA sequence.

542
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,020
So stop the video now and pause it.

543
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,380
Other thing can write it out

544
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,420
and see if you can choose one of these answers,

545
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,720
A, B, C, D, or E.

546
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:01,340
Okay, if you've thought about it for a little while,

547
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,940
hopefully you can come up with this answer,

548
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,540
D, methionine and valine.

549
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:11,140
That's because the first thing we need

550
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,620
for a protein synthesis is a start codon,

551
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:21,540
AUG. So this upstream curd-on is not going to be translated into protein. Remember we

552
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:29,140
need that start curd-on. Our next curd-on is GUA. If you look at our table here, that

553
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:40,700
encodes the baleen. Our UAA now, if we look at that in our table, so UAA can go to stop

554
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:45,980
curd on so that means we don't have any more amino acids being incorporated into

555
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,740
the protein after this point so the CAU here is not going to be made into part

556
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:57,160
of our protein so just keep that in mind when you look at protein sequences and

557
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:05,480
where proteins start and finish. That's it for this particular video so hopefully

558
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,680
you can understand the process of transcription and translation and some

559
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,440
of the specifics associated with these events.

560
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Thank you.
