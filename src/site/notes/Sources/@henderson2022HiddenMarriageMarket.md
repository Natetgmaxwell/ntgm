> “Incidentally, the marriage market is probably the strongest reason to pay  for expensive private schools. Going to Harvard may not get you a better  job but almost certainly puts you in an exclusive dating pool for life.” This is a quote from Bryan Caplanʼs superb book, The Case Against  Education. Heʼs alluding to assortative mating, or the trend whereby people  tend to personally choose romantic partners who are similar to themselves.

> Nicholas  Christakis summarizes research on arranged marriages in traditional  societies:  “To be absolutely sure about the relative amount of love in arranged  marriages, we would need to do an experiment in which people were  randomly assigned to either find their own partners or have their spouses  chosen by their parents. This is clearly impossible. But surveys in  nonexperimental (that is, real-world) conditions are nevertheless  informative. They have documented that satisfaction in arranged  marriages generally is not lower, and is sometimes even higher, than it is  in love matches. One study of couples who had been married for an  average of ten years found no statistical difference in self-reported ratings  on a scale of passionate love between couples in arranged marriages  compared to Western-style love matches. Respondents in another small  study of couples in arranged marriages from a variety of backgrounds rated their level of love on a scale of 1 to 10. It was 3.9 at the time of  marriage and 8.5 twenty years later.”

> Here's a passage from the author Susan Patton, a Princeton alumna who  earned some notoriety for her “Princeton Mom” letter wherein she gave  advice to current female students:  “For most of you, the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be  inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have  this concentration of men who are worthy of you... Of course, once you graduate you will meet men who are your intellectual equal—just not that  many of them. And, you could choose to marry a man who has other  things to recommend him besides a soaring intellect. But ultimately, it will  frustrate you to be with a man who just isnʼt as smart as you.”
