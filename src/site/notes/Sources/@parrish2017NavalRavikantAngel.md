> Real knowledge is intrinsic in that it's built from the ground up. So going  back to my math example earlier, you can understand trigonometry  without understanding arithmetic or geometry. So basically, someone is  using a lot of fancy words and a lot of big concepts. They probably don't  know what they're talking about. I think the smartest people can explain  things to a child. And if you can't explain it to a child, then you don't  know it. And I think that's very true. I know the common saying. But  Richard Feynman, very famously, if you go into his lecture, six easy  pieces where his early physics lectures, he has one where he basically,  he's like, you know, he's like explains mathematics in three pages. He  starts from the number line counting. And then he goes all the way to  pre calculus and he just builds it up through an unbroken chain of logic.  He doesn't rely on any definitions. You know, for example, if somebody  says like, oh, that bird is called this or, you know, the rule for this thing is  that they're not really telling you think fundamentally, they're telling you  about humans. They're telling you about naming systems. True  understanding is about algorithms, about understanding how things  connect to each other. So I think if the mark of a charlatan to try and  explain simple things in complicated ways, as the mark of a genius to  explain complicated things in simple ways. So really, they should be able to do it very, very, very, very simply. And I have to catch myself on this  because I have a big vocabulary that read a lot. So I can sound smarter  than I am just by using big words. But in the process, I'm being  dishonest with myself. It's okay to use more precise words. You know,  English is a big language with a lot of words. And so that allows for a lot  of precision.  But if you're deliberately using words that your audience doesn't know,  or if you even think you're using a word that your audience doesn't know  and you don't catch yourself and correct that, then you're essentially  being dishonest. You're just trying to show off. You're trying to pull one  over their eyes. There's a great book by Randall Munro, who is the  creator of XKCD, that very science-oriented comic. And it's called Upgo  or Five. It's a reference to Saturn Five rocket that took the Apollo  missions into space. And what he's doing in that book is he explains all  these very complicated concepts all the way from climate change to  physical systems to submarines and so on. But he does it using only the  thousand most common words in English language. So that's why he  calls the Saturn Five rocket Upgo or Five, because it's called a rocket.  You can't define a rocket as a spaceship or a rocket. It's used for selfreferential. He says, Upgo or it's this thing that goes up. And kids get  that right away. That's a singing explainer, right? The book, I think? Oh,  yeah. I'm sorry, you're right. Maybe the book is Thing Explainer. Yeah.  And Upgo or Five is one of the pages. There's another great book that I  call Thinking Physics. I open this one all the time. And I love on the back  cover it has this great little page. It says, the only book that's used in  both grade school and graduate school. That's true. It's all simple  physics puzzles that can be explained to a 12-year-old child they can be  a puzzle over and can be explained to a 25-year-old grad student in  physics. And they all kind of have fundamental insights in physics.  They're all kind of tricky, but anyone can get to the answer through  purely logical reasoning. I love reading the history of how scientists  came up with their various breakthroughs. And if you have ever gone,  like for example, relativity. Relativity is a fascinating thing.  It's a very advanced concept, but in a way it's very simple because  Einstein came up with what are called Gedankin and he worked for  thought experiments. He was thought experiment in German. So he was  able to basically just do logical thought experiments in his mind until he  came up with relativity. And then he formalized them with mathematics
