## Topics

##### Module 1

> [!cite]-

1. Describe the processes involved in drug regulation in Australia.
	- Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP)
	- Advisory Committee on Medicines Scheduling (ACMS)
		- Hold nominated members from each state
2. Describe the role of the medicinal chemist in improving drug action.
	- A medicinal chemist purifies the drug to increase efficiency and reduce potential side effects.
3. Describe the pharmacological effects and mechanism of action of Aspirin.
	- Aspirin is a [[Cards/Central Nervous System\|CNS]] depressant due to the effect of the hexane fraction of the ethanolic extract. Acetylation by aspirin blocks the catalytic site of the cyclooxygenase enzymes.
4. Describe the different phases of clinical trials and the processes for getting a new drug onto the Australian market

##### Module 02 - Cholinergic Pharmacology

1. Describe the effects of muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists, and some of the therapeutic uses of these drugs.
2. Describe the mechanism of action of depolarizing and non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs.
3. Describe the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin and tetanus toxin.

##### Module 03 - Adrenergic Pharmacology

1. Describe the pharmacological effects of stimulating $\alpha$‚ÇÅ, $\alpha$‚ÇÇ, $\beta$‚ÇÅ, $\beta$‚ÇÇ -adrenoceptors

2. Describe the pathways that lead to synthesis of noradrenaline and adrenaline

3. Describe the way in which the effect of noradrenaline may be terminated eg. Uptake 1, Uptake 2, etc.

4. Describe the therapeutic uses of sympathomimetic drugs, and the therapeutic uses of adrenergic receptor antagonists

##### Module 04 - Cardiovascular Drugs

1. Describe each of the major cardiovascular pathologies including arrhythmia, contractility defects, elevated cholesterol, and heart failure.
2. Describe the use of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin to treat arrhythmia.¬†
3. Describe the use of inotropic agents, beta-adrenergic agonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers to correct contractility defects.
4. Outline the mechanistic basis for use of statins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, PCSK9 and MTP inhibitors in the management of cholesterol.
5. Outline the mechanistic basis for use of diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARB blockers, beta blockers, and aldosterone antagonists in the treatment of heart failure.

##### Module 05 - Anti-hypertensive Drugs

1. Understand that lifestyle modifications, and other non-pharmacological strategies are used to treat hypertension.
2. Describe the mechanism of action of the different classes of diuretics used to treat hypertension.
3. Demonstrate an understanding of the RAAS and the mechanism of action of drug classes which target the RAAS in the treatment of hypertension.
4. Describe the mechanism of action of the other classes of drug used to treat hypertension.

##### Module 06 - Haemostasis and Thrombosis

1. Describe the clinical use of heparin, low molecular weight heparin, warfarin and the direct acting oral anticoagulants
2. Discuss the advantage of using a DOAC over warfarin
3. Discuss approaches to revascularisation, with comparison of fibrinolytic agents versus percutaneous coronary intervention.

##### Module 07 - Anti-inflammatory Agents

1. Describe the mechanisms of action of the "disease modifying anti-rheumatoid drugs (DMARDs)", methotrexate and immunomodulatory agents (glucocorticoids)
2. Describe the mechanism of action of target synthetic DMARDs and biologic DMARDs
3. Read Mishra et. al., Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol., 2020;76:1237-1243 and consider this in relation to the failed TeGenero Phase I drug trial.

2. Describe the treatment of status asthmaticus
3. Understand the mechanism for aspirin-sensitive asthma
4. Describe the treatment of COPD

##### Module 09 - Reproductive Pharmacology

1. Develop an understanding of hormonal control of the female and male reproduction systems.
2. Demonstrate an understanding of drugs used for the female reproduction system.
3. Gain an understanding of the drugs used for the make reproduction system.
