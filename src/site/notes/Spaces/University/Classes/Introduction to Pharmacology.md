## Topics

##### Module 1

> [!cite]-

- Describe the processes involved in drug regulation in Australia.
	- Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP)
	- Advisory Committee on Medicines Scheduling (ACMS)
		- Hold nominated members from each state
- Describe the role of the medicinal chemist in improving drug action.
	- A medicinal chemist purifies the drug to increase efficiency and reduce potential side effects.
- Describe the pharmacological effects and mechanism of action of Aspirin.
	- Aspirin is a [[Cards/Central Nervous System\|CNS]] depressant due to the effect of the hexane fraction of the ethanolic extract. Acetylation by aspirin blocks the catalytic site of the cyclooxygenase enzymes.
- Describe the different phases of clinical trials and the processes for getting a new drug onto the Australian market
