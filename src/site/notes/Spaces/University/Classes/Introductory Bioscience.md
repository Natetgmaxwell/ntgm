## Topics

### 1.1 Classifications of Matter

- Chemistry is concerned with the characteristics, composition, and transformation of matter.
- Matter includes all living and non-living objects and organisms and can exist in three physical states: solid, liquid, and gas.
- Physical changes involve changing the physical state of matter without altering its composition.
- Chemical changes result in a new substance with a different composition and properties.
- Matter can be classified into pure substances (elements and compounds) and mixtures (homogeneous and heterogeneous).
- Elements are the simplest form of matter, consisting of one type of material.
- Compounds are made up of two or more elements in a fixed composition.
- Mixtures can be separated into their components, either through filtration, chromatography, magnetism, or distillation.

### 10. Genetics and Inheritance

###### What is the definition of a gamete, and how does it relate to sexual reproduction?

- A [[Cards/Gametes\|gamate]] is a specialised [[Cards/Haploid Number\|Haploid]] cell that is responsible [[Cards/Sexual Reproduction\|Sexual Reproduction]]. Having a [[Cards/Haploid Number\|haploid]] gamete allows for the genetic makeup of offspring to bee split between the two parents.

###### What is the role of genes in the process of inheritance, and how do they carry genetic information from one generation to the next?

- [[Cards/Genes\|Genes]] are segments of [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]]. Every child carries two genes for a traitâ€”one from each parent. These genes code for proteins which determines an organisms traits.

###### What is the difference between [[Cards/Autosomal Chromosomes\|Autosomal]] and [[Cards/Sex Chromosomes\|Sex Chromosomes]]?

| [[Cards/Autosomal Chromosomes\|Autosomal Chromosomes]]                               | [[Cards/Sex Chromosomes\|Sex Chromosomes]]                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Arranged in pairs                                       | Single 'X' and 'Y' chromosome       |
| Carries traits that are not reliant on an organisms sex | Traits tied to an organisms [[Cards/Sex\|Sex]] |
| 22 Pairs                                                | 1 Pair                              | 

###### How does genetic variation results in offspring diversity?

- Each [[Cards/Gametes\|gamete]] contains a differing [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] due to the chance occurrence in crossing over during mitosis. The diversity is multiplied by the crossing over of one gamete from each parent.
