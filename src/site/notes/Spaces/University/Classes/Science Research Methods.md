## Topics

- 's' is the variation within a sample, whereas 's.e' is the variation between samples.
- A possible explanation for the sample mean of the pizza to be 11.8 and the stated value to be 12. The 11.8 for the sample mean is well within the 1 SD away from the mean, and could be due to sampling variation.
- **Conclusion Statement**
	- Very strong evidence exists in the same (t=-23.4; df=124; two tailed P less than 0.001) that the population mean pizza diameter of pizzas from Eagle Boys' is less than 12 inches (sample mean diameter: 11.49; Std.dev: 0.246; 95% [[Cards/Confidence Interval\|CI]] from 11.44 to 11.53 inches).
	1. Evidence <- linked to p-value
	2. Stats <- test statistic, df (degrees of freedom), tails & p-value
	3. Results <- trend/pattern
	4. Data <- mean, [[Cards/Standard Deviation\|SD]] or OODS
	5. [[Cards/Confidence Interval\|CI]] <- 95% range
- The research question only states that we are looking for the improved.
- $\mu_{Without Implant}=\mu_{With Implant}$
- The standard error is the variation between the individuals tested.

- Wording of Confidence intervals
	1. Parameter of Interest
	2. Comparison of Vars
	3. Data (mean, SD, proportion)
	4. Result -> What happened
	5. Stats & [[Cards/Confidence Interval\|CI]]
