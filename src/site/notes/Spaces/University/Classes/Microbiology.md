## Topics


## Review Questions

### Module 01

###### Define the science of Microbiology?

MicrobiologyÂ isÂ the study of microorganisms, or microbes, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, [[Cards/Archaea\|Archaea]], [[Cards/Algae\|Algae]], [[Cards/Fungi\|Fungi]], [[Cards/Protozoa\|Protozoa]], and [[Cards/Virus\|viruses]].

###### What is the [[Cards/Theory of Spontaneous Generation\|Theory of Spontaneous Generation]] and who disproved it?

- [[Cards/Louis Pasteur\|Louis Pasteur]]
- The hypothetical process that living organisms develop from non-living matter.

###### What is the [[Cards/Germ Theory of Disease\|Germ Theory of Disease]]?

- A theory that [[Cards/Micro-organisms\|microorganisms]] such as bacteria and [[Cards/Virus\|viruses]] cause [[Cards/Disease\|Disease]].

###### What are Kochâ€™s Postulates?

- A set of four criteria used to establish the relationship between a specific microorganism and [[Cards/Disease\|Disease]].

###### What are the origins of terms like [[Cards/Pasteurisation\|Pasteurisation]], Listeria, and Listerine? 

- [[Cards/Pasteurisation\|Pasteurisation]]
	- Named after Louis Pasteur in the late 19th century. 
	- He discovered that heating wine and beer eliminated spoilage-causing microbes. 
	- This technique was later applied to milk, reducing bacterial growth and extending shelf life.
- [[Cards/Listeria\|Listeria]]
	- Bacterium named after Dr. Joseph Lister, a British surgeon who introduced [[Cards/Antiseptic\|Antiseptic]] techniques in surgery. 
	- The bacterium "Listeria monocytogenes" can cause foodborne illness known as listeriosis. 
- Listerine
	- Originally a surgical [[Cards/Antiseptic\|Antiseptic]] formula developed by Dr. Joseph Lister, similar to his work with antiseptics for surgery. 
	- In the early 20th century, it was marketed as an over-the-counter product for various uses including oral health, named after its inventor.

###### How can the science of microbiology be used to understand the principles of Biological Sciences? Give examples. 



###### What is the current evidence for existence of first organisms on Earth and where are those located?

- *Fossil Records*
	- The earliest known fossils date back to around 3.5 billion years ago (Ga) in rock formations found in Greenland and Western Australia. These microbial mats, called stromatolites, are formed by the growth of [[Cards/Cyanobacteria\|Cyanobacteria]], which were one of the first life forms on Earth. These fossils provide evidence that photosynthesis occurred early in Earth's history.


###### Describe the metabolic evolution of the microorganisms following the formation of oxygen and ozone layer.

- *Anaerobic microorganisms* 
	- Prior to the oxygenation event, most microorganisms were anaerobic.

- *Formation of oxygen and ozone layer*
	- Around 2.4 billion years ago, photosynthetic [[Cards/Cyanobacteria\|Cyanobacteria]] started producing molecular oxygen (Oâ‚‚) as a byproduct during photosynthesis. 

- *Aerobic respiration*
	- As molecular oxygen accumulated, some microorganisms developed the ability to use it as more efficient energy production method. 
	- Led to the rise of aerobic organisms like mitochondria-containing eukaryotes and bacteria such as [[Cards/Proteobacteria\|Proteobacteria]].

- *Evolution of eukaryotes*
	- [[Cards/Symbiosis\|Symbiosis]] between a [[Cards/Proteobacteria\|proteobacterium]] and an ancient prokaryote allowed eukaryotes to harness energy more efficiently through aerobic respiration.

###### In bullet points, what are the three main lines of cellular descent?

- *Prokaryotes*
	- The first and earliest line includes single-celled organisms without a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles (e.g., bacteria and [[Cards/Archaea\|Archaea]]). They lack complex structures like mitochondria and chloroplasts but can perform photosynthesis in some cases.
- *Eukaryotes with [[Cards/Endosymbiotic theory\|endosymbiosis]]*
	- This line includes cells with a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles, developed through the process of [[Cards/Endosymbiotic theory\|endosymbiosis]] (e.g., eukaryotic [[Cards/Algae\|Algae]] and protists). They have complex structures like mitochondria for energy production and chloroplasts for photosynthesis in some cases.
- *Eukaryotes without [[Cards/Endosymbiotic theory\|endosymbiosis]]*
	- This line includes cells with a nucleus but no membrane-bound organelles (e.g., [[Cards/Fungi\|Fungi]], animals, and plants). They lack the specialized structures found in eukaryotic [[Cards/Algae\|Algae]] and protists but have complex multicellular forms like plants and animals.


###### Using a bullet list, What is [[Cards/Endosymbiotic theory\|Endosymbiotic theory]]? Describe the formation of early Eukaryotes?

- *[[Cards/Endosymbiotic theory\|Endosymbiotic theory]]*
	- The [[Cards/Endosymbiotic theory\|Endosymbiotic theory]] suggests that eukaryotic cells evolved from prokaryotic cells through a symbiotic relationship between two or more organisms. 

- Formation of Early Eukaryotes:
  * Merger of prokaryotic cells: It is believed that early eukaryotes formed through the merging of two or more prokaryotic cells, most likely [[Cards/Archaea\|Archaea]] and/or bacteria. This fusion allowed for the exchange of genetic material between the cells and led to the development of a more complex cellular structure.
  * Incorporation of endosymbionts: Over time, certain endosymbiotic bacteria (usually photosynthetic [[Cards/Cyanobacteria\|cyanobacteria]]) became incorporated within larger host cells. These endosymbionts eventually lost their ability to function independently and instead began to specialize in performing specific functions within the eukaryotic cell.
  * Evolution of organelles: The endosymbiotic bacteria evolved into organelles such as mitochondria (in aerobic cells) and chloroplasts (in photosynthetic cells). These membrane-bound structures allowed for increased efficiency in energy production, leading to the development of more complex life forms.
  * Reduction in genetic material: As the endosymbiotic bacteria became more specialized within the eukaryotic cell, their genetic material was gradually transferred to and incorporated into the host cell's genome. This process resulted in a reduction of the symbiont's genome size while increasing the complexity of the host cell's genome.
  * Development of eukaryotes: Over millions of years, this evolutionary process led to the formation of early eukaryotic cells with complex structures and organelles, eventually giving rise to diverse life forms such as plants, animals, [[Cards/Fungi\|Fungi]], and protists.
