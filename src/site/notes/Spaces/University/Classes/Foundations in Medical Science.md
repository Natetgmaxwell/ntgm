###### Which Sections of a [[Cards/Pathology\|Pathology]] Laboratory Would Use Whole Blood?

- Clinical Biochemistry
- Immudohaematology

###### How is Whole Blood Collected for Testing?

1. Prepare the Collection Materials
	- Gather all necessary materials, such as a tourniquet, phlebotomy kit, and vacutainer tubes.
2. Explain the Procedure to the Patient
	- Inform the patient about the procedure, including its purpose, benefits, and potential side effects. Obtain their verbal consent.
3. Position the Patient Comfortably
	- Place the patient in a comfortable position, such as lying down on an examination table or sitting in a chair with their arm supported.
4. Clean the Vein Access Site
	- Use an alcohol swab to clean the area where the blood will be drawn. This helps minimise infection risk and ensures accurate vein location.
5. Apply Tourniquet
	- Securely wrap the tourniquet around the patient's upper arm, just above their elbow. This constricts the underlying veins, making them more visible and easier to access for blood collection.
6. Identify and Prepare the Vein
	- Locate a suitable vein using landmarks or by palpating the vein with your fingers. Clean the area where the needle will enter with an alcohol swab.
7. Insert the Needle into the Vein
	- Using aseptic technique, insert the phlebotomy needle into the chosen vein at a shallow angle. Ensure that you hit bone if you are unsure of correct placement.
8. Collect Blood in Vacutainer Tubes
	- Attach the vacutainer tubes to the needle's collection port and allow blood to flow into them. Fill each tube as per protocol, ensuring enough volume for analysis.
9. Remove Needle and Apply Pressure
	- Once all blood has been collected, remove the needle and apply pressure to the site using a sterile gauze pad or cotton ball. Hold pressure for several minutes until bleeding stops.
10. Label and Transport Blood Samples
	- Clearly label each vacutainer tube with the patient's name, date of collection, and any relevant information. Store them securely at an appropriate temperature before transporting to the laboratory for analysis.

> [[Cards/Polycythaemia#^eb7796\|Polycythaemia#^eb7796]]

###### What is the Typical Colour of Plasma and Serum?

- What is the typical colour of plasma and serum?

###### Which Does not Contain Clotting Factors â€“ Serum or Plasma? Explain why

Clotting factors are proteins that help in blood coagulation, and they are primarily found in the platelets and plasma of the blood. While both serum and plasma come from blood, they have different compositions. When left to coagulate the serum is left and therefore contains no clotting factors.

###### What is the 'buffy Coat' of a Centrifuged Blood Sample, and what Does it Consist Of?

*The Buffy Coat of a Centrifuged Blood Sample:*

- The Buffy coat is the layer of white cells that forms on top of the red blood cell-rich plasma after a blood sample has been spun in a centrifuge.

*Consists Of:*

- It primarily consists of leukocytes (white blood cells), with platelets and some plasma proteins also present.

###### What Material is Commonly Used as Clot Activators in SST Tubes?

The material commonly used as clot activators in SST (Sodium Silicate) tubes is Thrombin.

Thrombin plays a crucial role in the blood coagulation process. It activates platelets and converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which forms a mesh that stabilises the clot.

In SST tubes, Thrombin acts as an initiator of the coagulation cascade, promoting clot formation for diagnostic purposes.

###### Why is Sodium Fluoride Used as an Additive? It is Found in Fluoride Oxalate Tubes.

Sodium fluoride is used as an additive in Phlebotomy due to its antimicrobial properties and ability to enhance the stability of blood samples. In fluoride oxalate tubes, it helps prevent bacterial or fungal contamination and maintains the integrity of the sample during storage and transportation.

###### Why Are Tourniquets Used during Venipuncture?

1. Make veins more visible and easier to locate.
2. Minimize discomfort by temporarily reducing blood flow.
3. Enhance the efficiency of needle insertion, leading to a smoother procedure overall.

###### What Are Common Hazards Associated with the Collection of Arterial Blood?

*Common hazards associated with collecting arterial blood include:*

1. Arterial spasm due to rapid blood withdrawal.
2. Hemolysis from excessive manipulation of red blood cells.

Capillary or venous blood collection is generally safer, as it involves less pressure-sensitive vessels and lower risks for clotting or hemolysis.

###### What Does a [[Cards/Blood Gas Analyser\|Blood Gas Analyser]] Measure in a Sample of Arterial Blood?

1. **Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)** - The amount of oxygen pressure in the blood.

2. **Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)** - The amount of carbon dioxide pressure in the blood.

3. **pH** - A measure of acidity or basicity in the blood, with a lower pH indicating higher acidity and a higher pH indicating more basicity.

4. **Bicarbonate concentration (HCO3-)** - The level of bicarbonate ions in the blood, which helps buffer against changes in pH.

5. **Oxygen saturation (SaO2)** - The percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells.

These measurements help assess a patient's respiratory and acid-base status, aiding in diagnosing conditions like hypoxemia or respiratory acidosis.

###### What is a Normal Control and Abnormal Control in relation to [[Cards/Pathology\|Pathology]] Tests?

A *normal control* refers to the baseline values or ranges that are considered typical for a specific test or biomarker. These values help establish a reference point for comparison when assessing an individual's results.

An *abnormal control*, on the other hand, indicates that the tested values fall outside of the expected range or are indicative of a potential health issue. This information can be crucial in diagnosing and monitoring conditions through [[Cards/Pathology\|Pathology]] tests.

###### Briefly Describe the Difference between Assayed and Un-assayed Control Materials Used for Internal Quality Control in a Laboratory.

Assayed control materials are certified to have specific characteristics, while unassayed ones lack such certification. Both types serve as reference standards for testing procedures, but only assays provide verified results.

###### What is the Difference between the Sensitivity and Specificity of a Diagnostic Test? (Use a Formula for Each term).

Sensitivity refers to the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the test, while specificity refers to the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified by the test. The formulas for calculating sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) are as follows:

$$Sn = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)$$

$$Sp = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)$$

###### What is a True Positive and a True Negative Test Result?

True Positive (TP): A test result that indicates a person has the disease when they actually do have it.
True Negative (TN): A test result that indicates a person does not have the disease when they actually don't have it.

###### What is the Predictive Value (PV) of a Diagnostic Test? In Your Answer, Briefly Explain the Difference between a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and a Negative Predictive Value (NPV). (Use a Formula for Each term).

The predictive value (PV) of a diagnostic test is the probability that it will correctly identify individuals with the condition. 

$$PV = (true positives + true negatives) / (total number of tests)$$

Positive Predictive Value (PPV): PPV represents the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have the condition. The formula for PPV is: 

$$PPV = (true positives) / (true positives + false positives)$$

Negative Predictive Value (NPV): NPV indicates the capacity of a test to accurately exclude individuals without the condition. The formula for NPV is: 

$$NPV = (true negatives) / (true negatives + false negatives)$$

###### What Do the terms â€˜bimodalâ€™ and â€˜polymodalâ€™ Mean?

[[Cards/Bimodal\|Bimodal]] refers to a distribution with two distinct peaks, indicating that data is grouped into two main modes or categories.
