    - Adaptive immunity has humoral and cellular responses mediated by B cells and T cells.
2. **Humoral and Cellular Immunity:**
    
    - Humoral response is by B cells secreting antibodies; cellular response involves T cells.
    - Antibodies neutralise extracellular [[Cards/Micro-organisms\|microbes]], while cellular response targets intracellular pathogens.
3. **Helper T [[Cards/Lymphocytes\|Lymphocytes]] in Cellular Immunity:**
    
    - Helper T cells aid [[Cards/Macrophages\|macrophages]] and [[Cards/Neutrophils\|neutrophils]] against intracellular pathogens.
    - Cytotoxic T cells destroy infected cells, exposing pathogens for antibody action.
4. **Antigen Processing and Receptors:**

    - Endogenous antigen (MHC type 1) processes infected body cells, often by viruses.
5. **Clonal Selection and Expansion:**
    
    - Clonal expansion increases B and T cell numbers in response to antigen-presenting cells.
    - Differentiation leads to specific categories of B and T cells, tailored to [[Cards/Infection\|infection]] type.
6. **Antigen Elimination and Homeostasis:**
    
    - Antigen elimination phase activates humoral and cellular immunity against [[Cards/Infection\|infection]].
    - Contraction phase follows, where many cells die, allowing renewal and homeostasis.

    - Antibodies have Y-shaped structures and perform various immune functions.
9. **Cytokines and Immune Activation:**
    
    - Activated B and T cells release cytokines that mediate inflammation, swelling, and mucus secretion.
    - Plasma cells (B cells) secrete antibodies; cytotoxic T cells directly attack infected cells.
10. **Assessing Immune Response:**
    
    - A formula assesses immune response based on lymphocyte and leukocyte percentages in blood.
    - Total CD4 lymphocyte count indicates immune system health and disease severity.
11. **Barriers and Non-Specific Defenses:**
    
    - Skin, mucus, and membranes serve as initial barriers to pathogens.
    - Non-specific defenses include phagocytic cells, natural killer cells, inflammation, and fever.
12. **Specific Immune Responses:**
    
    - Pathogens bypass barriers; if successful, non-specific defenses are activated.
    - If [[Cards/Infection\|infection]] persists, specific immune responses involve humoral and cellular immunity.
