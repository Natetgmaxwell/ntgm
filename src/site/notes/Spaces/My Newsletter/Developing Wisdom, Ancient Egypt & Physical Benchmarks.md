# Developing Wisdom, Ancient Egypt & Physical Benchmarks
### How One Can Develop Profound Wisdom, the Impacts of Ancient Civilizations and Physical Benchmarks for Optimal Health

Quote of the week comes from [[Cards/Robert Greene\|Robert Greene]] and 50 Cents' _The 50th Law_.

> "His superiority, he realised, was that he knew that he knew nothing. This left his mind open to experiencing things as they are, the source of all knowledge." (referring to Socrates, an ancient greek philosopher)

This shows how acknowledging our [[Cards/Ignorance\|Ignorance]] is a strength in which we are always open to learning more and being proven wrong, constantly building our knowledge and Wisdom. Your knowledge can be leveraged in decision-making, and the more 'data' you have to draw upon, the more justified and accurate your decision will be. 

The process of extracting newfound Wisdom from knowledge, information and, in the most basic sense, data can be seen in [[Cards/DIKW Pyramid\|DIKW Pyramid]] (seen below).

Data to Information -- Adds Context

Information to Knowledge -- Infers ideas and patterns, therefore, adds meaning.

Knowledge to Wisdom -- Adding insights and actionable steps

Some people are knowledgeable but cannot convert this knowledge into actionable steps of Wisdom. Developing Wisdom comes from a greater understanding of the subject matter and the underlying concepts of 'why?' From understanding the underlying concepts, you can apply the knowledge to various situations, not just the intended case. 

### 3 Insights of the Week

#### 1. Influential Ancient Civilisation

You may be surprised at how much a civilisation that existed 5000 years ago could profoundly impact modern society as we know it today. These people created the first account of written history by creating ink and paper, while also inventing shaving and haircuts. Here are a couple of things that you might not have known were developed by the Ancient Egyptians.

**Calendars**

Ancient Egypt created the 365-day calendar to help anticipate agricultural seasons and when the Nile river would flood. The Egyptians also coined the 12-month calendar. And recognised that there were 5 days left over, comprising the months which now have 31 days.

**Paper and Ink**

The Egyptians also were the first to document their history through the use of ink and paper. Derived from vegetable gum, soot and bee wax. While the paper came from the papyrus leaves.

**Makeup**

Makeup was worn by the Egyptians as a [[Cards/Status\|Status]] symbol, while also being worn for religious purposes. The rich upper-class men and women would wear large amounts of makeup.

**Breath Mints**

Breath mints were created to serve the purpose of disguising problematic [[Cards/Teeth\|teeth]] and bad breath. As their meals often contained sand wearing down the [[Cards/Enamel\|Enamel]] and allowing for cavities and diseases to form.

**Shaving and Haircuts**

The climate of northeast Africa promoted the Egyptians to create shaving and hair cuts. As long hair would be looked upon as unhygienic while being most uncomfortable. Since shaving was considered hygienic it was used as a [[Cards/Status\|Status]] symbol, and on the contrary, stubble was considered lower class.

**Door Locks**

Egyptian were also the first to invent in the door lock. However, these locks were quite large and cumbersome the lock and unlock. They were also typically more than half a meter in size, prompting refinement in the coming millennia.

**Bowling**

It was also discovered that the Egyptians played ball games similar to modern-day bowling, with sets of lanes 4-meters in length.

#### 2. Befriending Your Inner Monologue

That voice inside your head often has a reputation for creating internal havoc. However, what if I told you that this voice could be your greatest asset and not a weakness of the human condition?

**Alleviating Bias**

Talking to yourself in the second person (using your name or referring to yourself through the pronoun 'you') can help alleviate self biases and gain perspective on situations. Distant self-talk lets you think as if you're helping someone else and perceiving the situation objectively.

**Short-Term Memory**

Through sub-vocal repetition, your inner voice can store information as Short Term-Memory, particularly numbers and strings of words comprising short phases. Also, asking yourself questions is a way of querying your Short Term-Memory. You may not be able to answer the question immediately; however, your [[Cards/Subconscious\|Subconscious]] mind will ponder this while you continue with your life.

**Personal Coach**

The inner voice can also be used as a coach for counting reps at the gym and self-reassurance in times of trial. The self-reassurance helps drown out the negative chatter while focusing on the task.

#### 3. Physical Benchmarks for Optimal Health

Being physically capable is a crucial feature of our lives. Being physically capable incorporates all aspects of movement, including mobility, flexibility, strength and conditioning. Here are some areas of movement, categorised by age, that should be met for optimal health, keeping in mind that the exercise builds upon one another.

**8 - 18**

The basic skills outlined by Georges Hébert

- Pursuit (Walk, Run, Crawl)

- Escape (Climb, Balance, Climbing, Swimming)

- Attack (Throwing, Lifting, Fighting, Cycling, Break Falling (correctly and safely))

**18 - 55**

- Bench press bodyweight

- At least five pull-ups

- Deadlift 150% bodyweight

- Bodyweight squat

- Turkish getup with a half-filled cup of water (mobility and flexibility)

- Maximum Aerobic Function (MAF) test (aerobic conditioning)

**55 +**

- Stand on one foot for 10 seconds?

- Deep squat and hold for 30 seconds, then stand up (mobility, flexibility & strength)

- Hang from a bar for 30 seconds

- Pick up your body weight and move it (lift does not matter)

- Standing long jump of your height.

- Being able to sit and stand up from the floor

- Regularly walk on complex and uneven surfaces.
