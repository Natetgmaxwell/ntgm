- A [[Cards/Mutation\|Mutation]] that changes the bases in a [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] molecule.
- Change to the bases in a [[Cards/Codon\|Codon]] can change the [[Cards/Amino Acids\|amino acid]] that it codes for.
- When a base is changed it has a follow-on effect as the bases must be complementary.

### Consequences
1. [[Cards/Silent Mutation\|Silent Mutation]] - No Effect
2. [[Cards/Missense Mutation\|Missense Mutation]] - New [[Cards/Amino Acids\|amino acid]]
3. [[Cards/Frameshift Mutation\|Frameshift Mutation]] - addition or deletion of more [[Cards/Nucleotides\|Nucleotides]], forming new [[Cards/Amino Acids\|Amino Acids]] from that point on
4. [[Cards/Nonsense Mutation\|Nonsense Mutation]] - causes the formation of the [[Cards/Stop Codon\|Stop Codon]]
