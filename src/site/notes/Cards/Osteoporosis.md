# Osteoporosis

> Osteoporosis weakens [[Cards/Bone Tissue\|bones]] to the point that they can break easily. It is called a “silent disease” because people who develop it may not notice any changes until a bone breaks — usually a bone in the [[Cards/Pelvis\|hip]], [[Cards/Spine\|Spine]], or [[Cards/Wrist\|Wrist]].
