> [!Definition] Definition
> Metalic bonding is a type of chemical bond that occurs between metal atoms. It involves the sharing and transfer of electrons to create positive ions called cations, which are surrounded by delocalized electrons forming a "sea" within the lattice structure. This electron sea contributes to strong interatomic attractions leading to high melting points, electrical conductivity, malleability, and ductility in metals.

- Metalic Bonds have free flowing electrons to conduct electric charges [[Sources/Video/@davidmckay2024SCI105M01T02Chemical\|@davidmckay2024SCI105M01T02Chemical]].
