> [!Definition] Definition
>  Covalent bonds are strong chemical connections formed between two atoms sharing one or more pairs of electrons to achieve a stable electronic configuration. These bonds occur when two [[Cards/Non-Metals\|non-metal]] elements have similar electronegativities, resulting in equal electron-sharing and shared stability.
