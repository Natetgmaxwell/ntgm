> The reproductive asexual spores of Streptomyces, called *conidiospores*, are formed at the ends of aerial filaments. If each conidiospore lands on a suitable substrate, it is capable of germinating into a new colony.

> Streptomyces is the best known and most studied of the actinomycetes, and one of the bacteria most commonly isolated from soil.

> These organisms ([[Cards/Streptomyces\|Streptomyces]]) are **strict aerobes**. They often produce extracellular enzymes that enable them to utilize proteins; polysaccharides, such as starch; cellulose, and many other organic materials found in soil. Streptomyces characteristically produce a gaseous compound called geosmin, which gives fresh soil its typical musty odor.

> In some studies, **close to 50% of all Streptomyces sp. isolated have proved to be antibiotic producers.**

> One hypothesis speculates that antibiotic production, which is linked to sporulation (a process itself triggered by nutrient depletion), might be a mechanism to inhibit the growth of other organisms competing with differentiating Streptomyces cells for limiting nutrients.
