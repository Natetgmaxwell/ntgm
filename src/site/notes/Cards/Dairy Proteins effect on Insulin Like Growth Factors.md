> Notably, higher intakes of total and dairy protein and calcium were highly significantly associated with elevated concentrations of IGF-I and lower concentrations of IGFBP-2.

> There are several mechanisms through which the intake of protein from [[Cards/Dairy Products\|Dairy Products]] or calcium may increase serum concentrations of IGF-I. The presence of specific essential amino acids in dairy protein at particular concentrations may influence IGF-I concentrations either by up-regulating IGF-I gene expression (39) or reducing the clearance of IGF-I from the circulation (40).
