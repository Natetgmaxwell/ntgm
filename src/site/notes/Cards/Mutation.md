- Mutations are changes in genetic material, usually in [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]. [[Cards/Mutation\|Mutations]] happen randomly and by chance.
- Errors in [[Cards/DNA Replication\|DNA Replication]] can lead to [[Cards/Mutation\|mutations]] when these errors are not corrected by proofreading enzymes ([[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]]).

## Types of Mutations

#### Base Substitutions

- [[Cards/Silent Mutation\|Silent Mutation]]
- [[Cards/Missense Mutation\|Missense Mutation]]
- [[Cards/Nonsense Mutation\|Nonsense Mutation]]

#### Insertions or Deletions

- [[Single Mutation\|Single Mutation]]
- [[Multiple Mutation\|Multiple Mutation]]
- [[Cards/Frameshift Mutation\|Frameshift Mutation]]
- [[Large Scale Mutations\|Large Scale Mutations]]

> [!Definition] Definition
> Germline mutations occur in the sex cells (sperm or eggs) during meiosis, which leads them to be passed on to offspring. These alterations are present from conception and can influence an individual's entire life, potentially leading to inherited diseases if they have a significant impact on gene function.

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!Definition] Definition
> Somatic mutations occur in the body's non-germline cells after fertilisation, meaning that each person has their unique set of somatic mutations. These alterations do not get passed on to offspring but can cause various health issues if they affect essential genes or cellular processes.
