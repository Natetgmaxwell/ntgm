- Mutations are changes in genetic material, usually in [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]]. [[Cards/Mutation\|Mutations]] happen randomly and by chance.
- Errors in [[Cards/DNA Replication\|DNA Replication]] can lead to [[Cards/Mutation\|mutations]] when these errors are not corrected by proofreading enzymes ([[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]]).

## Types of Mutations

### Location of the Mutation
1. [[Cards/Germline Mutation\|Germline Mutation]]

> [!Definition] Definition
> Germline mutations occur in the sex cells (sperm or eggs) during meiosis, which leads them to be passed on to offspring. These alterations are present from conception and can influence an individual's entire life, potentially leading to inherited diseases if they have a significant impact on gene function.

2. [[Cards/Somatic Mutation\|Somatic Mutation]]

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



> [!Definition] Definition
> Somatic mutations occur in the body's non-germline cells after fertilisation, meaning that each person has their unique set of somatic mutations. These alterations do not get passed on to offspring but can cause various health issues if they affect essential genes or cellular processes.

## [[Cards/Abiotic Factors\|Abiotic Factors]] Factors
External factors like radiation, chemicals, and viruses can also induce mutations. Ionising radiation damages DNA molecules directly through ionisation or indirectly by creating reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to base modifications or chromosomal aberrations. Chemicals can act as mutagens when they interact with DNA, altering its structure and disrupting the replication process. Viruses can integrate their genetic material into host cells during infection, introducing new mutations and potentially triggering oncogenic transformation in some cases.
