> [[Cards/Phosphatidic acid\|Phosphatidic acid]] enhances mTOR signaling and resistance exercise-induced hypertrophy[717]. Phosphatidic acid gets regulated by exercise which activates mTORC1[718] . You can find phosphatidic acid in [[Cards/Cabbage\|Cabbage]] leaves, [[Cards/Radish\|Radish]] leaves, and herbs as well[719] but also in supplements.
