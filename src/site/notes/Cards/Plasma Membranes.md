# Reference

- [[Cards/Electrophoresis\|Electrophoresis]] (breaks-down [[Cards/Plasma Membranes\|Plasma Membranes]])
- [[Cards/Cholesterol\|Cholesterol]] (part of the [[Cards/Plasma Membranes\|membrane]] and maintains membrane fluidity and stability, forms lipid rafts, modulates protein activity)

## Flashcards

Oxygen and carbon dioxide can squeeze between the lipid molecules in the plasma membrane. (True or False);;True
<!--SR:!2024-11-06,2,230-->

Ions easily diffuse across the cell membrane by [[Cards/Simple Diffusion\|simple diffusion]] (True or False);;False
<!--SR:!2024-11-06,2,190-->

What is the cell membrane's structure, and what is its role?;; The cell membrane is a lipid bilayer that creates a barrier between [[Cards/Extracellular Fluid\|ECF]] and [[Cards/Intracellular Fluid\|ICF]]. The sodium-potassium ATPase pump maintains the electrochemical gradient by pumping three sodium ions out and two potassium ions in.

What is the hydrophilic part of a phospholipid?;;The phosphate group.

The insides of membranes are [[Cards/Hydrophobic\|hydrophobic]], therefore which type of amino acids would you expect to find in helixes of these proteins: those with polar or nonpolar side chains?;;Non-polar proteins
