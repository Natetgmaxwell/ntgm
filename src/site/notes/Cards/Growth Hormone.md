What is the target for [[Cards/Growth Hormone\|Growth Hormone]] and it's action upon those tissues?;;Targets bones muscles and hepatocyte of the liver, promoting growth and metabolism
<!--SR:!2025-04-15,8,250-->

Does growth hormone (GH) act directly on cells in tissue s and organs to stimulate growth?;;Growth hormone can directly bind to target cell eliciting growth but an also indirectly stimulate growth through the stimulating the release of [[Cards/Insulin-like growth factor 1\|IGF-1]]
<!--SR:!2025-05-11,19,250-->

What is the major effect that GH has on bone tissue?;;Stimulates [[Cards/Osteoblast\|Osteoblast]] activity and proliferation
<!--SR:!2025-05-16,24,250-->

Summarise the metabolic effects of GH;;Stimulates [[Cards/Lipolysis\|Lipolysis]], break down [[Cards/Lipids\|Lipids]], and synthesis of proteins.
