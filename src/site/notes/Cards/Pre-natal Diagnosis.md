## Methods of [[Cards/Pre-natal Diagnosis\|Pre-natal Diagnosis]]

- [[Cards/Chorionic Villus Sampling\|CV Sampling]]
- [[Cards/Foetoscopy\|Foetoscopy]]
- [[Cards/Cordocentesis\|Cordocentesis]]

- ~30 conditions are tested for, the most common are:
	- Phenylketonuria (PKU)
	- Hypothyroidism, in which not enough thyroid hormone is produced and can cause intellectual disability and growth problems if untreated
	- [[Cards/Cystic Fibrosis\|Cystic fibrosis]] ([[Cards/Cystic Fibrosis\|CF]]), an untreatable but manageable condition which causes the lungs and gastrointestinal system to produce an abnormal mucus that clogs the affected organs and stops them from working properly
	- [[Cards/Galactosaemia\|Galactosaemia]]
