### Most effective Forms of Cold Exposure Therapy
1. Ice Bath
2. Cold Shower
3. Atmospheric Exposure

- Cold Exposure therapy can also increase the production of [[Cards/Brown Adipose Tissue\|Brown Adipose Tissue]] as the body recognises the increasing need for insulation to accommodate [[Cards/Thermoregulation\|Thermoregulation]].
- Induces the [[Cards/Parasympathetic State\|Parasympathetic State]]
- [[Cards/Cold Exposure Therapy\|Cold Exposure Therapy]] increases [[Cards/Metabolism\|Metabolism]] as the body needs to work harder to maintain its [[Cards/Core Body Temperature\|Core Body Temperature]].
- [[Cards/Cold Exposure Therapy\|Cold Exposure Therapy]] can decrease the time needed to recover from training.
- However, [[Cards/Cold Exposure Therapy\|Cold Exposure Therapy]] can limit [[Cards/Hypertrophy\|Hypertrophy]] by decreasing [[Cards/Blood\|Blood]] flow to the muscles.
- If one has competition or intense training the following day, wait 3 hours before engaging in [[Cards/Cold Exposure Therapy\|Cold Exposure Therapy]]. This will allow the initial adaptions and recovery to set in already.

### Pre-Exercise Cooling [[Sources/Books/@jamesdinicolantonio2021WinAchievePeak\|@jamesdinicolantonio2021WinAchievePeak]]

> “[[Cards/Cold Exposure Therapy#Pre-Exercise Cooling\|Pre-cooling]] seems to improve performance by reducing the rise in [[Cards/Core Body Temperature\|Core Body Temperature]], lowering sweat rate,  and  increasing  oxygen  supply  to  working  muscles.”

- Use pre-exercise cooling baths 30mins to >1 hour
- Use temperatures from 18˚C to 28˚C for optimal results, staring at 28˚C and dropping 2˚C every 10 minutes
- Water cooler than 15˚C has been shown to decrease performance
- Check [[Cards/Core Body Temperature\|Core Body Temperature]] 3 minutes after for a drop of at least 0.3˚C
- Perform a 10 minute warmup after cold water immersion

> If there is no access to an ice bath of some sorts, you can attach ice packs to the [[Cards/Glabrous skin\|Glabrous skin]] regions and check every 10 minutes to monitor [[Cards/Core Body Temperature\|Core Body Temperature]] to achieve the 0.3˚C drop.
