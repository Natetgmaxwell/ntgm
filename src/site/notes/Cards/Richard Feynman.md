> But [[Cards/Richard Feynman\|Richard Feynman]], very famously, if you go into his lecture, six easy pieces where his early physics lectures, he has one where he basically, he's like, you know, he's like explains mathematics in three pages. He starts from the number line counting. And then he goes all the way to pre calculus and he just builds it up through an unbroken chain of logic. He doesn't rely on any definitions.^[Extracted from [[Sources/@parrish2017NavalRavikantAngel\|@parrish2017NavalRavikantAngel]]]

> A lifelong prankster, he treated authority and the academic establishment with the same sort of disrespect he showed for stuffy mathematical formalism. Never one to suffer fools gladly, he broke the rules whenever he found them arbitrary or absurd.
