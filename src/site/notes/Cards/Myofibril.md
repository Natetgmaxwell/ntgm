The myofibril is a cylindrical organelle of skeletal [[Cards/Myocyte\|muscle cells]] that is responsible for force production and relaxation. These specialised [[Cards/Myocyte\|muscle cells]] are composed two type of protein filaments, thick and thin filaments. The thick filaments are composed of [[Cards/Myosin\|myosin]], whereas the are composed of [[Cards/Actin\|actin]], troponin and tropomyosin. These filaments are systematically arranged into recurring units known as sarcomeres, which serve as the operative units for muscle contraction. It is these filaments interact and slide past each other which results in muscle contraction ([[Physiological Aspects of Legged Terrestrial Locomotion\|cavagnaPhysiologicalAspectsLegged2017]]).
