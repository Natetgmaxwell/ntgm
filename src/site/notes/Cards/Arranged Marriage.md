> Nicholas Christakis summarizes research on arranged marriages in traditional societies: “To be absolutely sure about the relative amount of love in arranged marriages, we would need to do an experiment in which people were randomly assigned to either find their own partners or have their spouses chosen by their parents. This is clearly impossible. But surveys in nonexperimental (that is, real-world) conditions are nevertheless informative. They have documented that satisfaction in arranged marriages generally is not lower, and is sometimes even higher, than it is in love matches. One study of couples who had been married for an average of ten years found no statistical difference in self-reported ratings on a scale of passionate love between couples in arranged marriages compared to Western-style love matches. Respondents in another small study of couples in arranged marriages from a variety of backgrounds rated their level of love on a scale of 1 to 10. It was 3.9 at the time of marriage and 8.5 twenty years later.”
