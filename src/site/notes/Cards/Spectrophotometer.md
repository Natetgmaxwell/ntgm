> Any substance (analyte) to be measured on a spectrophotometer must be either: – Naturally coloured: • Example: [[Cards/Hemoglobin\|Hemoglobin]] in blood is naturally coloured and can be measured by spectrophotometry. – Capable of being coloured: • Example: Glucose in blood plasma is not coloured but can be converted to a coloured compound with chemical reagents.
