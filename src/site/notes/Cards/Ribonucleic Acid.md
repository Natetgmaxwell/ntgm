## Flashcards

What is the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic mRNA?;;Prokaryotic mRNA can encode multiple genes, while eukaryotic mRNA typically encodes only one gene.
<!--SR:!2024-11-07,2,130-->

If we extracted mRNA from thyroid and neuronal cells, we would find the same sets of mature mRNA molecules in both types of cells?;;no
<!--SR:!2024-11-15,43,250-->

What is a secondary and tertiary RNA structure? How are these structures formed?;;2nd RNA strutures and based on complementary based paired hydrogen bonds. 3rd RNA structures and more complex the 2nd with electrostatic forces (Van wals forces)
<!--SR:!2024-11-21,17,217-->

What are some uses of secondary and tertiary structured RNAs in eukaryotic cells?;;2nd RNA uses include gene regulation and protein translation. 3rd RNA can catalyze biochemical reactions
<!--SR:!2024-11-14,1,130-->

Describe two similarities between the miRNA and [[Cards/siRNA\|siRNA]] pathways;;Both pathways involve the dicer and RISC complex
<!--SR:!2024-11-15,2,194-->

Describe two differences between the miRNA and [[Cards/siRNA\|siRNA]] pathways;;miRNAs are endogenously expressed by the host genome. In contrast, siRNAs are typically introduced into the cell through transfection or other means
