1. [[Cards/Predation\|Predation]]
2. [[Cards/Interspecific Competition\|Competition]]
3. [[Cards/Mutualism\|Mutualism]]
4. [[Cards/Commensalism\|Commensalism]]

## Impacts of Interspecific Interactions

[[Cards/The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection\|The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection]] can have an impact on [[Cards/Interspecific Interactions\|Interspecific Interactions]], as the competition over resources becomes scares resulting in [[Cards/Competitive Exclusion\|Competitive Exclusion]]. Such as [[Cards/Predation\|predators]] may be forced to [[Cards/Predation\|predate]] other organisms outside their usual diet.
