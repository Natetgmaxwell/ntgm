## Flashcards

What are the stages of [[Cards/Protein Synthesis\|Protein Synthesis]] in order?;;[[Cards/RNA Transcription\|RNA Transcription]] and [[Cards/RNA Translation\|RNA Translation]], [[Cards/Post Translation Modification\|Post Translation Modification]] (in [[Cards/Eukaryote\|Eukaryotes]])
<!--SR:!2023-12-02,151,270-->

What is the main difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes in terms of protein production?;;In prokaryotes, proteins are fully functional after translation, while in eukaryotes, proteins may require [[Cards/Post Translation Modification\|post-translational modification]] to be active

Name three differences in translation between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells?;;Eukaryotes’ ribosomes are larger, Translation in eukaryotes generally requires more  factors for initiation, elongation, and termination than  translation in bacteria does, Many ribosomes are not free-floating as they are in  bacteria but instead are associated with the  endoplasmic reticulum.
