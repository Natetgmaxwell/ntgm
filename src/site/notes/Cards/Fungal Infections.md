## Some [[Cards/Fungal Infections\|Fungal Infections]] Are

- Athlete's foot (tinea pedis), which affects the skin and nails of the feet and toes, causing itching, burning, cracking, peeling, or blisters. It can be spread by direct contact with an infected person or surface, or by walking barefoot in public places where the fungus is present.
- Ringworm (tinea corporis), which affects the skin of the body, causing round patches of red, scaly, or inflamed skin that may blister or ooze. It can be contracted by touching an infected animal or person, or sharing personal items with someone who has it.
- Jock itch (tinea cruris), which affects the skin of the genitals and inner thighs, causing a red, scaly rash that may be very itchy or cause a burning sensation. It can be transmitted by sexual contact, or by wearing tight clothing that traps moisture and heat.
- Yeast infection (cutaneous candidiasis), which affects the skin and nails of any part of the body, causing redness, itching, scaling, flaking, or cracking. It can be caused by hormonal changes, [[Cards/Antibiotics\|antibiotic]] use, stress, diabetes, or other factors that lower the acidity of the skin or weaken the immune system.
- Onychomycosis, which affects the nails and surrounding skin of the fingers or toes, causing discoloration, thickening, splitting, or deformation of the nails. It can be caused by fungal spores that enter through a cut or separation in the nail plate, or by wearing tight shoes that restrict blood flow to the feet.
