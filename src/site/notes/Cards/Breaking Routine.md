> Unlucky people tend to be creatures of routine. They tend to take the same route to and from work, interact with the same social circles, and talk to the same types of people at parties. In contrast, lucky people tend to introduce lots of variety into their lives. (source). Relatedly, as writes, “collect as many lottery tickets as you can.”
