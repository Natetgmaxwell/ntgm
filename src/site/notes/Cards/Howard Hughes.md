> ”The pattern of Howard Hughes’s life was set from very early on. His mother had an anxious nature, and after learning she could have no more children, she directed a great deal of her [[Cards/Anxiety\|Anxiety]] toward her only son. She smothered him with constant [[Cards/Attention\|attention]]; she became his closest companion, almost never letting him out of sight. The father placed tremendous expectations on his son to carry on the family name. His parents determined everything he did—what he wore, what he ate, and who his friends were (although they were few).”

> ^ [[Cards/Howard Hughes\| Hughes’]] need to micromanage others came from his experiences in early-childhood, where his parents made all the decisions for him—what he wore ate and who his friends were. Through suppressing his ability to make decisions for himself his parents, [[Cards/Howard Hughes\| Howard]] viewed differing opinions as a challenge to his individualism.
