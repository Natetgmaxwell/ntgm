[[Cards/Marfan Syndrome\|Marfan Syndrome]] (MFS) is a common heritable disorder of [[Cards/Connective Tissue\|Connective Tissue]] with an autosomal dominate inheritance pattern. MFS is characterised by an array of symptoms, primarily in the ocular, cardiovascular and [[Cards/Skeletal System\|skeletal systems]]. However can also effect the lungs, skin and dura. The prevalence of [[Cards/Marfan Syndrome\|Marfan Syndrome]] in 1 in 5000-10000^[[[@laurencefaivre2007EffectMutationType\|[@laurencefaivre2007EffectMutationType]]], and has a large variability in age of onset and clinical manifestations. 

Clinical features that can be used to diagnose MFS include a tall slender frame with disproportionately lone limbs (legs & arms) relative to the rest of the body. Vertebral deformity including scoliosis and thoracic lordosis. This disorder and by extension the listed symptoms are primarily caused by a mutation in the FBN1 gene, which encodes for the fibrillin-1 protein. However, can have other implicated genes including LTBP2, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, and MYH11 that contribute to the phenotypic variety^[[[@han2024TargetedNextgenerationSequencing\|[@han2024TargetedNextgenerationSequencing]]].

The FBN1 gene on [[Cards/Chromosome 15\|Chromosome 15]] encodes for the fibrillin-1 protein. With fibrillin-1 being a large extracellular matrix [[Cards/Glycoprotein\|Glycoprotein]], serving as a structural component of microfibrils in [[Cards/Connective Tissue\|Connective Tissue]]^[[[@sakai2016FBN1DiseaseCausingGene\|[@sakai2016FBN1DiseaseCausingGene]]].
