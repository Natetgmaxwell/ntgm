> The experts found one particular lineage from 1,000 years ago that belonged to Khan himself and revealed that 1 in 200 men alive today are his descendants. Coincidentally, some scholars estimated that he impregnated more than 1,000 women during his reign. The geneticists added that the expansion of Khan’s territory and the spread of his seed were correlated.

> Published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, “The Genetic Legacy of the Mongols” found that 0.5 percent of the world’s male population were Khan’s genetic descendants and that 8 percent of men living in his former territory had identical Y-chromosomes.
