> What happened was that some individual or group of individuals ﬁrst invented a primitive version of the artifact or practice, and then some later user or users made a modiﬁcation, an “improvement,” that others then adopted perhaps without change for many generations, at which point some other individual or group of individuals made another modiﬁcation, which was then learned and used by others, and so on over historical time in what has sometimes been dubbed “the ratchet effect”
