> [!Definition] Definition
> Germline mutations occur in the sex cells (sperm or eggs) during meiosis, which leads them to be passed on to offspring. These alterations are present from conception and can influence an individual's entire life, potentially leading to inherited diseases if they have a significant impact on gene function.
