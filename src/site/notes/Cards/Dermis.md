## Flashcards

What does the dermis contain, and what are its functions?;;The dermis contains [[Cards/Blood Vessels\|blood vessels]], nerves, and connective tissues. Its functions include providing nutrients to the [[Cards/Epidermis\|epidermis]], supporting sensory receptors for touch, pressure, and temperature, and protecting underlying soft tissues.
<!--SR:!2023-11-02,12,160-->

What are some types of sensory receptors found in the dermis?;;Sensory receptors in the dermis include free nerve endings, root hair plexus, tactile discs, bulbous corpuscles, lamellar corpuscles, and tactile corpuscles, responsible for touch, pressure, and temperature sensations.

Describe the changes in the dermal layer due to aging.;;Slower regeneration, reduction in collagen and elastin production, leading to wrinkles.
