> Lyndon Baines Johnson was the 36th president of the United States. Born on August 27, 1908, he served from November 22, 1963, until January 20, 1969. Johnson assumed office following the assassination of John F. Kennedy and went on to win a full term in his own right in the 1964 election.

## Early Life and Political Career

Johnson was born near Stonewall, Texas, into a large family with deep political roots. His mother, Rebekah Ella "Rebekah" Baines, had a profound influence on him, instilling strong moral values in her son from an early age. Johnson attended Southwest Texas State Teachers College but did not graduate; however, his involvement in student government laid the foundation for his future political career.

After serving as a teacher and principal, Johnson entered politics. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1937, where he served until 1949. In 1948, he won election to the U.S. Senate, where he would serve for more than two decades before becoming vice president under John F. Kennedy in 1960.

## Presidency

Johnson's presidency was marked by significant domestic and foreign policy achievements. Domestically, his administration pursued a bold agenda of social reform known as the "Great Society." Key initiatives included the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the War on Poverty. Johnson also played a crucial role in advancing civil rights and desegregation efforts throughout the United States.

On the foreign policy front, Johnson faced numerous challenges during his presidency. He inherited the ongoing Vietnam War from Kennedy, which would ultimately become a major point of controversy both domestically and internationally. Despite this, Johnson's administration made strides in improving relations with the Soviet Union through the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the Non-Proliferation Treaty.
