> What do you recommend for your typical individual in a given week so I usually start with the question of how much time are you willing to give to this process you know people always say Well Peter what do you do and it's like that's not that's not relevant what I do right tell me what you're willing to do and we will we will work with that and by the way the math is pretty much The same for everybody it's take whatever that number is divided in half half of that is going to be strength and stability half of that is going to be cardio the strength stability should Be divided such that about 80 percent of it is strength 20 percent of its stability the cardio should be divided such that about 80 percent of it is zone two and 20 percent of it is VO2 max Specific training that in a nutshell is the simplest formula for how to divide your time in exercise.^[[[@griscom2023OUTLIVEPartPeter\|[@griscom2023OUTLIVEPartPeter]]]
