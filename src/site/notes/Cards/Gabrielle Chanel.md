"What she wanted was the power and freedom that men possessed, which was reflected in the less constricting clothes that they wore."

- [[Cards/Gabrielle Chanel\|Gabrielle Chanel]] surrounded herself with an aura of mystery.
- Her cloths combined comfort/ freedom of movement with sex appeal. The new design of cloths gave young adults the chance to rebel the customs of their parents, creating their own style and sense of freedom.
- Induced a sense of [[Cards/Fear of Missing Out\|FOMO]]. Her cloths were desirable because everybody else had them. She saw her own personal desires in her romantic life to wanted men that other woman already had; seeing that they were desired by other woman made her also desire them. [[Cards/Gabrielle Chanel\|Gabrielle Chanel]] then used this same strategy to market her fashion products.
