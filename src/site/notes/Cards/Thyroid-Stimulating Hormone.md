How does TSH affect metabolism within the body?;;TSH indirectly regulates overall basal metabolic rate through its influence on the secretion of thyroid hormones, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones have widespread effects on cellular respiration, protein synthesis, and thermogenesis.
