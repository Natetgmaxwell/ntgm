What is the primary role of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)?;;To stimulate and regulate the secretion of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland.

Which part of the endocrine system releases TSH?;;The anterior pituitary gland.

How does TSH affect metabolism within the body?;;TSH indirectly regulates overall basal metabolic rate through its influence on the secretion of thyroid hormones, such as triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones have widespread effects on cellular respiration, protein synthesis, and thermogenesis.
