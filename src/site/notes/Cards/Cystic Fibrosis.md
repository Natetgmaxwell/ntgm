## Effect of CF

- **[[Cards/Malnutrition\|Malnutrition]] through [[Cards/Malabsorption\|Malabsorption]]**
	- Thick mucus stops the [[Cards/Pancreas\|pancreas]] from sending enzymes into the intestines, which are needed for the body to absorb nutrients in food
	- A defect in the intestines prevents nutrients from passing into the bloodstream.
