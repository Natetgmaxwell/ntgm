> “When exercising in a hot environment, [[Cards/Sweat\|sweating]] can make you lose up to 1-2 liters of water per hour. However, sweat doesn’t only contain water – it’s  also  made  of  [[Cards/Sodium\|salt]]  and  other  [[Cards/Electrolytes\|Electrolytes]].”

> “The  amount  of  *[[Cards/Sodium\|sodium]]  in  our  [[Cards/Sweat\|Sweat]]  generally  ranges  between  40-60 mEq/Liter (920-1,380 mg/Liter)* and we sweat out about 1 to 1 ½ liters per hour  in  moderate  temperatures  and  around  2  to  3  liters  per  hour  in  hot temperatures”
