> “Sprinting as fast as you can and doing multiple cycles of this  (known as supra-maximal interval training or [[Cards/Supramaximal Interval Training\|SMIT]]) can *boost [[Cards/Blood\|Blood]] volume in just a few days*,  which will help to increase endurance and speed during performance. The idea is to sprint all out for 30-60 seconds, with short breaks (30-60 seconds) and repeat these cycles for 3-8 cycles (or to failure)”

> In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that exercise of supramaximal intensity is a potent stimulus for the rapid expansion of [[Cards/Blood Volume\|Blood Volume]] following short-term exercise.
