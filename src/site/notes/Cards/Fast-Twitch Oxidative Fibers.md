> [!Definition] Definition
> [[Cards/Fast-Twitch Oxidative Fibers\|Fast-Twitch Oxidative Fibers]] are a subtype of fast-twitch [[Cards/Muscle Tissue\|Muscle Fibers]]. They have a high capacity for both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism, allowing them to generate quick and powerful movements, but also to sustain contractions for longer periods than pure fast-twitch fibers.

- [[Cards/Fast-Twitch Oxidative Fibers\|FO fibers]] have high amounts of [[Cards/Mitochondria\|Mitochondria]] and [[Cards/Myoglobin\|Myoglobin]], supplying [[Cards/Oxygen\|Oxygen]] to the muscles.
- Also have high amounts of [[Cards/ATPase\|ATPase]] and [[Cards/Oxidative Enzyme\|Oxidative Enzyme]]
