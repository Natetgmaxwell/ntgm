What are the different types of infection?

There are different ways to classify infections, depending on the cause, location, or severity of the disease. Some common types of infection are:

- [[Cards/Bacterial Infections\|Bacterial infections]]: These are caused by bacteria, which are single-celled microorganisms that can live in various environments, such as soil, water, or human body. [[Cards/Bacterial Infections\|Bacterial infections]] can affect different parts of the body and have different symptoms and treatments. Some examples of [[Cards/Bacterial Infections\|bacterial infections]] are strep throat, pneumonia, meningitis, and food poisoning.
- [[Cards/Viral Infections\|Viral Infections]]: These are caused by viruses, which are much smaller than bacteria and can only reproduce inside living cells. Viruses can infect animals, plants, or humans and cause various diseases. Some examples of [[Cards/Viral Infections\|Viral Infections]] are the common cold, flu, HIV/AIDS, and COVID-19.
- [[Cards/Fungal Infections\|Fungal Infections]]: These are caused by [[Cards/Fungi\|Fungi]], which are eukaryotic organisms that decompose organic matter and can also cause diseases in humans or animals. [[Cards/Fungal Infections\|Fungal Infections]] can affect the skin, nails, hair, lungs, or blood. Some examples of [[Cards/Fungal Infections\|Fungal Infections]] are athlete's foot, ringworm, yeast infection, and histoplasmosis.
- [[Cards/Parasitic infections\|Parasitic infections]]: These are caused by parasites, which are organisms that live on or inside another organism and derive nutrients from them. [[Cards/Parasitic infections\|Parasitic infections]] can affect the intestines, blood, liver, lungs, or brain. Some examples of [[Cards/Parasitic infections\|Parasitic infections]] are malaria, giardia, toxoplasmosis, and schistosomiasis.
- Protozoan infections: These are caused by protozoans, which are single-celled eukaryotic organisms that can infect humans or animals and cause various diseases. Some examples of protozoan infections are leishmaniasis, amoebic dysentery, and trichomoniasis.
