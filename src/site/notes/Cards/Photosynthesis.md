- [[Cards/Photosynthesis\|Photosynthesis]] is the process of transforming sunlight into [[Cards/Chemical Energy\|Chemical Energy]]. Inside the cells of plants are organelles called [[Cards/Chloroplasts\|Chloroplasts]], which contain the pigment [[Cards/Chlorophyll\|Chlorophyll]]. This pigment absorbs most of the wavelengths in sunlight and creates [[Cards/Carbohydrates\|Carbohydrates]], with the byproduct of [[Cards/Oxygen\|Oxygen]]. 

- In order to synthesise [[Cards/Carbohydrates\|Carbohydrates]], [[Cards/Autotrophs\|Autotrophs]] require [[Cards/Water\|Water]] and [[Cards/Carbon Dioxide\|Carbon Dioxide]].
