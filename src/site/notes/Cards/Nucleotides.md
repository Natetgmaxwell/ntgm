> A nucleotide is a molecule that is the building block of DNA and RNA. It consists of a nitrogenous base ([[Cards/Adenine\|Adenine]], [[Cards/Guanine\|Guanine]], [[Cards/Cytosine\|Cytosine]], or [[Cards/Thymine\|Thymine]] in DNA; [[Cards/Adenine\|adenine]], guanine, [[Cards/Cytosine\|cytosine]], or uracil in RNA), a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA), and a [[Cards/Phosphate\|Phosphate]] group.
