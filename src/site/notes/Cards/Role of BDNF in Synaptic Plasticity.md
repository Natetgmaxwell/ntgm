> [!Definition] Definition

BDNF exerts its effects on synaptic plasticity through several mechanisms:

1. **Neurogenesis**: BDNF stimulates the production of new neurons in the [[Cards/Hippocampus\|hippocampus]], a brain region critical for learning and memory. These newly generated neurons contribute to the formation of new synaptic connections and enhance synaptic plasticity.

2. **Synaptic Formation**: BDNF promotes the growth and formation of new synapses between neurons. It enhances the structural and functional connectivity between neurons, facilitating the transmission of signals and the formation of new memories.

3. **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)**: BDNF plays a crucial role in the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation, a cellular process that underlies the strengthening of synaptic connections. LTP is considered one of the cellular mechanisms of learning and memory.
