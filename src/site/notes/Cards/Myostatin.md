> [!Definition] Definition
> Myostatin, also known as growth-differentiation factor 11 (GDF11), is a protein that inhibits [[Cards/Myocyte\|muscle cell]] differentiation and growth. It is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle tissue and acts as a negative regulator of muscle mass. Myostatin deficiency or deletion can result in increased muscle size and strength, similar to the condition seen in some cattle breeds called double-muscled animals. Humans with excessive myostatin levels may have reduced muscle growth and strength.

> Myostatin is a substance that inhibits muscle growth by suppressing hypertrophy[704] . It’s basically your body’s attempt to shut down muscle growth as a way to preserve energy from an evolutionary perspective.

> Leucine, HMB and creatine monohydrate also prevent myostatin’s inhibitory effects on muscle growth[710] .
