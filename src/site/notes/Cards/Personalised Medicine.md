- Analysis of a gene or group of genes (sequencing, SNP) to predict drug response
- Prediction of sensitivity to beneficial or adverse effects
- Development of drugs tailored to individuals genetic make-up

## What is [[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]]?

Personalised medicine is a system of clinical medical practice that is rapidly revolutionising health care strategies. The concept of [[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]] is based on the idea that individuals possess unique characteristics at a molecular, physiological and an epigenetic level^[[[@goetz2018PersonalizedMedicineMotivation\|[@goetz2018PersonalizedMedicineMotivation]]]. Therefore differentiating itself by considering each persons nuanced characteristics (influenced by the aforementioned factors) when determining optimal treatment and prevention strategies^[[[@chan2011PersonalizedMedicineProgress\|[@chan2011PersonalizedMedicineProgress]]]. Health care that embraces [[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]] utilises the understanding of molecular [[Cards/Pathology\|Pathology]] to assess an individuals susceptibility to [[Cards/Disease\|Disease]] thus providing an optimised preventative strategies. 

[[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]] has garnered greater attention in the preceding decade as technologies have increased understanding of individualised physiology. However, despite the promise that is [[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]]  it still faces barriers in implementation by governance bodies and health care system which will be discussed later.

## Motivations for [[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]]

There is motivation for [[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]] by both the patient or clinician and the pharmaceutical industry. 

### Big Pharama

The industry of drug discovery has traditionally been a linear process, including; discovery & validation, preclinical trials, clinical trials & FDA approval. [[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]] can integrate the discovery and trial process resulting in:

- Increased efficiency and reduced costs for target discovery, including new gene targets
- Reduced time and cost in commencing [[Cards/Clinical Trial\|clinical trials]]

A major burden for the pharmaceutical industry is adverse drug reactions. In western countries adverse drug reactions accounted for 6.7% of all hospitalisations and is the fourth and sixth greatest cause of fatalities in the US. 

### Patient & Clinician

[[Cards/Personalised Medicine\|Personalised Medicine]] offers the ability to select the right treatment for an individual patient using various biomarkers, whilst administering the optimal dose quantity and timing for their specific physiology. Some identified benefits are:

- Improved efficacy through more individually targeted treatments.
- Improvement in survival rates
- Reduced side/adverse effects

A patients genome greatly influences the patients susceptibility to a particular pharmacological agent while also determining if the patient in question is a responder, non-responser and avoid adverse drug reactions.
