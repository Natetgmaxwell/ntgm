> [!definition] Definition
> Stem cells are a type of cell that has the ability to differentiate into specialized cells and divide to produce more stem cells. They serve as a repair system for the body, replenishing injured tissues and organs. Stem cells can be found in many multicellular organisms, including humans.

> [!quote] [[Sources/Research Papers/@ayavoo2021RolesMechanismsStem\|@ayavoo2021RolesMechanismsStem]]
> Stem cells are unspecialized cells derived from adult body tissues and embryos that differentiate into any cell of an organism and capable of self-regeneration.
