> [!Definition] Definition
> Myosins are a family of motor proteins that play a critical role in muscle contraction, cell motility, and other cellular processes. They contain a head domain that interacts with [[Cards/Actin\|actin]] filaments and hydrolyses [[Cards/Adenosine triphosphate\|ATP]] to produce mechanical force and movement. Myosins have diverse functions in different cell types, including muscle contraction, [[Cards/Cell Division\|Cell Division]], [[Cards/Intracellular Transport\|Intracellular Transport]], and sensory [[Cards/Sensory Transduction\|Sensory Transduction]].
