What are algae? Describe their roles in nature.;;Relatively simple non-flowering eukaryotic photoautotrophs that lack the tissue (roots, stem, and leaves) of plants. Unicellular and filamentous forms. Mostly Aquatic. Fix carbon dioxide into molecules that can be consumed by chemoheterotrophs. Estimated that 80% of Earths oxygen is produced by planktonic [[Cards/Algae\|Algae]].
