> [!Abstract]+
> A groundbreaking manifesto on living better from the world's top longevity expert.This is the ultimate manual for longevity.For all its successes, mainstream medicine has failed to make much progress against the diseases of ageing that kill most people- heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and type 2 diabetes. Too often, it intervenes with treatments too late, prolonging lifespan at the expense of quality of life. Dr Peter Attia, the world's top longevity expert, believes we must replace this outdated framework with a personalised, proactive strategy for longevity.This isn't 'biohacking,' it's science- a well-founded strategic approach to extending lifespan while improving our physical, cognitive and emotional health, making each decade better than the one before. With Outlive's practical advice and roadmap, you can plot a different path for your life, one that lets you outlive your genes to make each decade better than the one before.

> f we all maintained the apoB levels we had when we were babies, there wouldn’t be enough heart disease on the planet for people to know what it was. Kind of like 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria. What, you haven’t heard of it? Well, that ’s because there have been only thirteen reported cases. Ever. That is an orphan disease. I ’m being a bit facetious, but my point is that atherosclerotic disease shouldn’t even be in the top ten causes of death, if we treated it more aggressively. Instead, we have over eighteen million cases of fatal atherosclerotic disease per year globally

> Monounsaturated fats, found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados (among other foods), do not have this effect, so I tend to push my patients to consume more of these, up to about 60 percent of total fat intake. The point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profile.
