> The problem with the academic world is in effect it's got a top of the class syndrome. The people who are top of the class in primary school love this feeling so much that they want to keep it. So they choose the subjects in secondary school where they can stay top of the class. And they love that feeling so much that when they go to university they choose a subject where they excel. And they keep doing this ad infinitum until they remain the best at their field in the world. But in the process, they lose sight of virtually everything else. Whereas the generalist is is lumbered with the cliche of being a jack of all trades and master of none. When things are relatively stable, you actually really value the expertise of precise and detailed understanding in one domain, and I'm not knocking that for a second. But in times of relative flux, this is the time of the generalist. This is a time where you really need to be good at synthesis. So, the expert generalist is a way of taking generalist understanding seriously and trying to give it a bit of institutional and societal respect because the problem with generalism has no status.^[[[@jonathanrowson2024PhilosopherSocialScientist\|[@jonathanrowson2024PhilosopherSocialScientist]]]
