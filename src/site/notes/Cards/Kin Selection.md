> A wonderful British biologist, recognized that you can do things that decrease your own reproduction even, and that can still be selected for so long as there are benefits to relatives Who have the exact same genes as you do, including those genes for cooperation. What's an example of that? Actually, the anecdote that one has to tell when talking about this is from the famous socialist biologist JBS Haldain back in the 40s. Someone asked them, but a pub, would you sacrifice your life for your brother? And he says, no, I don't think I would, but I went for two brothers or for eight cousins. And that really says it better than any fancy math I could do.

- Since humans cannot look at another humans [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] to determine they might be related, they use the other organisms [[Cards/Phenotype\|Phenotype]] as a proxy ([[Sources/Podcasts/@williamson2023TonyVolkEvolutionary\|@williamson2023TonyVolkEvolutionary]]). 
- Additionally being raised together indicates genetic similarity, hence mediates [[Cards/Insest Aversion\|Insest Aversion]] amongst children raised together but not related.
