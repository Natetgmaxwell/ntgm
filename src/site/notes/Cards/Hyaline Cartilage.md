> Hyaline cartilage is a type of cartilaginous connective tissue that has a smooth and glassy appearance. It is found in various parts of the body, such as the nose, trachea, larynx, ears, and joints. Hyaline cartilage consists of chondrocytes (cartilaginous cells) surrounded by a matrix of [[Cards/Collagen\|collagen]] and proteoglycans. The matrix provides strength and elasticity to the tissue.
