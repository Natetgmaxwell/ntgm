> [!Definition] Definition
> Bone tissue is a type of connective tissue that forms the skeleton and provides support, protection, and movement to the body. It consists of cells called osteocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and minerals. Bone tissue can adapt to mechanical stresses by remodeling its structure and composition.
