> [!Definition] Definition
> [[Cards/Fast-Twitch Glycolytic Fibers\|Fast-Twitch Glycolytic Fibers]] are a subtype of fast-twitch muscle fibers. They have a high capacity for anaerobic metabolism, but relatively low capacity for aerobic metabolism. [[Cards/Fast-Twitch Glycolytic Fibers\|Type 2b]] [[Cards/Muscle Tissue\|muscle fibers]] [[Cards/Fatigue\|Fatigue]] rapidly and are not well-suited for sustained activities.
