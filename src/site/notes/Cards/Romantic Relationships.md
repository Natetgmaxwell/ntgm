## The Importance of Choosing the Right Person in a [[Cards/Romantic Relationships\|Romantic Relationship]]

> [!quote] [[Sources/@henderson2022HiddenMarriageMarket\|@henderson2022HiddenMarriageMarket]]
> Here's a passage from the author Susan Patton, a Princeton alumna who earned some notoriety for her “Princeton Mom” letter wherein she gave advice to current female students: “For most of you, the cornerstone of your future and happiness will be inextricably linked to the man you marry, and you will never again have this concentration of men who are worthy of you... Of course, once you graduate you will meet men who are your intellectual equal—just not that many of them. And, you could choose to marry a man who has other things to recommend him besides a soaring intellect. But ultimately, it will frustrate you to be with a man who just isnʼt as smart as you.”
