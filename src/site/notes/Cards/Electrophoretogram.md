## Typical Blood [[Cards/Electrophoretogram\|Electrophoretogram]] Pattern in a Healthy Individual

The typical separation pattern for serum protein bands in an electrophoretogram of a normal healthy person's serum sample would show distinct, separated bands representing different proteins. The albumin band (the fastest-moving protein) would be at the top, followed by alpha-1 globulin, alpha-2 globulin, transferrin, and finally the slowest-moving protein, orosomucoid.
