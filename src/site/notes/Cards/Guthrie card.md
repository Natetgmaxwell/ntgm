> A [[Cards/Guthrie card\|Guthrie card]] is a blood-spot test collection device used to screen newborns for certain metabolic disorders. It's named after Dr. Robert Guthrie, who developed the test.

### Diseases screened for in neonates using a Guthrie card are:

1. Phenylketonuria (PKU): A genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down and use phenylalanine, an amino acid found in many foods.
2. Hypothyroidism: A condition where the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough hormones, which can cause growth and developmental delays if not treated early.
