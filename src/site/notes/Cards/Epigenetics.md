# Epigenetics

> [!Definition] Definition
> Epigenetics is the study of inherited changes in gene expression without changes to DNA sequence.

- **[[Cards/Epigenetics\|Epigenetics]]** refers to differences in traits caused by environmental factors that can be [[Cards/Inheritance\|inherited]].

> "Epigenetics essentially means above genetics, and it's where we look at heritable changes in gene expression that don't involve changes to the DNA sequence."

## Environmental Factors that Can Affect [[Cards/Epigenetics\|Epigenetics]]

- [[Cards/Radiation\|Radiation]]

### Example 1 (Mice)

- Agouti mice are yellow and tend to overeat; therefore, their offspring may be prone to [[Cards/Cancer\|cancer]] and diabetes.

### Example 2 (Human Sex differentiation)
