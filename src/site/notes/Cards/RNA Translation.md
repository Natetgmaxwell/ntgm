- Occurs in the [[Cards/Ribosomes\|Ribosomes]]
- Where the [[Cards/Codon\|Codon]] of the [[Cards/Ribonucleic Acid#mRNA - **Messenger**\|mRNA]] joins with the [[Cards/Ribonucleic Acid#tRNA - **Transfer**\|tRNA]]
- When completed the [[Cards/Ribosomes\|Ribosome]] has formed a [[Cards/Polypeptide\|Polypeptide]]

What are the three steps in elongation during [[Cards/RNA Translation\|RNA Translation]]?;;binding of the tRNA to the ribosome, bonding of the peptides, translocation of the ribosome

What molecular mechanisms cause the movement of the ribosome along the mRNA strand? Why is GTP hydrolysis needed in the elongation process?;;GTP releases energy needed for the ribosome to move long the mRNA strand

What signals termination of translation to occur and describe what happens next to terminate the translation process?;;release factors cleave the peptide chain, releasing it from the ribosome.

List 4 key components required for translation;;mRNA, Initiation factors, elongation factors, GTP
<!--SR:!2024-11-06,1,230-->

The large ribosome subunit has 3 sites: A, P and E. In which site will the polypeptide chain be present during translation?;;P-site

The translation termination is encoded by a codon on the mRNA that correlates to which amino acid on the tRNA?;;[[Cards/Stop Codon\|Stop Codon]]
