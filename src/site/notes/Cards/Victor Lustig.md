## Rules


1.  Be a patient listener (it is this, not fast-talking, that gets a con-man his coups)
2.  Never look bored
3.  Wait for the other person to reveal any political opinions, then agree with them
4.  Let the other person reveal religious views, then have the same ones
5.  Hint at sex talk, but don’t follow it up unless the other person shows a strong interest
6.  Never discuss illness, unless some special concern is shown
7.  Never pry into a person’s personal circumstances (they’ll tell you all eventually)
8.  Never boast – just let your importance be quietly obvious
9.  Never be untidy
10.  Never get drunk
