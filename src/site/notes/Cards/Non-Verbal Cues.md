> [!insight]
> The [[Cards/Non-Verbal Cues\|Non-Verbal Cues]] listed above are generally too obvious for people to decode and sow distrust within a group—making the individual look like they are less [[Cards/Altruism\|altruistic]]. Hence, the individual will try and suppress these cues, however, the initial [[Cards/Emotion\|Emotion]] is visible for less than a second before the person becomes aware and suppresses it.
