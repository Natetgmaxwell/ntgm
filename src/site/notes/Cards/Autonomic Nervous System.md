## Flashcards

What is the autonomic nervous system responsible for?;; The autonomic nervous system automatically regulates smooth and cardiac muscles, glands, and [[Cards/Adipose Tissue\|Adipose Tissue]]. It includes the [[Cards/Parasympathetic Nervous System\|parasympathetic]] (rest and digest) and sympathetic (fight or flight) divisions.
<!--SR:!2024-05-18,12,160-->

What is the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) responsible for?;; The ANS controls involuntary functions of visceral effectors like smooth and cardiac muscles, glands, and adipocytes.
<!--SR:!2023-12-20,74,250-->

How does the ANS differ from the somatic nervous system?;; The ANS has a two-neuron system with autonomic ganglia between the [[Cards/Spinal cord\|spinal cord]] and effector organs, while the somatic nervous system has a one-neuron system with direct control over skeletal muscles.
