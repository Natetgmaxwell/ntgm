> [!quote] How [[Cards/Micheal Jackson\|Micheal Jackson]] created [[Cards/Desire\|Desire]]
> "He	[Micheal Jackson] was	deeply	aware	of	the	dangers	of	saturating	the market	with	his	music	and	public	appearances.	He	spread	out	the releases	of	his	albums,	making	the	public	hungry	for	more.	He carefully	managed	the	frequency	of	his	interviews	and	performances and	never	talked	about	the	meaning	of	his	lyrics	or	propagated	any overt	message.	He	occasionally	had	his	publicists	leak	to	the	press some new story	surrounding	him,	such	as	his	use	of	hyperbaric chambers	as	a	way	to	maintain	eternal	youthfulness.	He	would	neither confirm	nor	deny	these	stories	and	the	press	would	run	wild.	He	was someone	who	sparked	stories	and	rumours,	but	nothing	concrete."^[extract from [[Sources/Books/@robertgreeneLawsHumanNature2018\|@robertgreeneLawsHumanNature2018]]]
