> So quantum mechanics unifies the idea ofthe field and its waves, and the particles, all into one. Now it is true that when the frequency is low, the field aspect of the phenomenon is more evident, or more useful as an approximate description in terms of everyday experiences. But as the frequency increases, the particle aspects of the phenomenon become moreevident with the equipment with which we usually make the mea-surements.
