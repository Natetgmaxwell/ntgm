> Mitosis makes new cells for **growth** and **recovery**.

*Before mitosis starts, the parent cell grows and replicates its DNA ([[Cards/DNA Replication\|DNA Replication]]) during interphase.*

## Steps of Mitosis (PMAT)
1. **[[Prophase\|Prophase]]** - [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] condenses into [[Cards/Chromosomes\|Chromosomes]] as the nuclear envelope breaks down
2. **[[Metaphase\|Metaphase]]** - The [[Cards/Chromosomes\|Chromosomes]] then align at the equator of the cell
3. **[[Anaphase\|Anaphase]]** - The sister [[Cards/Chromatids\|Chromatids]] are pulled apart to the poles of the cell
4. **[[Telophase\|Telophase]]** - The nuclear envelopes form and [[Cards/Chromosomes\|Chromosomes]] uncoils
