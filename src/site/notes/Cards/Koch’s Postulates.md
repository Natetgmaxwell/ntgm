> [!Definition] Definition
> Koch's postulates are a set of four criteria used to establish the causal relationship between a specific [[Cards/Micro-organisms\|microorganism]] and a particular disease.

### Infectious Agent Can Be Proven to Cause a Certain Disease if it Satisfies These Conditions:

1. The organism must be consistently found at the site of the diseased tissue.
2. It should be isolated and grown in pure culture under controlled laboratory conditions.
3. When introduced into healthy, susceptible host animals, the cultured microorganisms must reproduce the same disease it was originally associated with.
4. The organism can then be consistently re-isolated from diseased tissue of these new hosts.
