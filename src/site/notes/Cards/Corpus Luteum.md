The corpus luteum is a temporary endocrine structure that forms in the [[Cards/Ovaries\|ovary]] after ovulation and plays a crucial role in early pregnancy. It is composed of cells that are derived from the [[Cards/Graafian follicle\|Graafian follicle]], which ruptured to release the egg during ovulation. The corpus luteum produces two important hormones: progesterone and estrogen.

Progesterone helps to prepare the uterus for pregnancy by thickening the [[Cards/Endometrium\|endometrium]], while estrogen supports the growth of the embryo. The corpus luteum is essential for maintaining pregnancy during the first trimester, as it regulates the secretion of these hormones and ensures that the uterus remains supportive of fetal development.

For example, studies have shown that women who experience luteal phase defects, or problems with corpus luteum function, are at a higher risk of miscarriage. Additionally, the corpus luteum has been found to be important for the regulation of maternal immune tolerance, ensuring that the mother's immune system does not attack the fetus as a foreign entity.

In summary, the corpus luteum is a crucial structure in the [[Cards/Ovaries\|ovary]] that plays a central role in early pregnancy by producing hormones that support fetal development and maintaining a supportive uterine environment.Ô∏è
