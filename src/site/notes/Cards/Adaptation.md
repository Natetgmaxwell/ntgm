Adaptation allows species to remain [[Cards/Interspecific Competition\|competitive]] in their environment while becoming more efficient.

## 3 Types of Adaptation

1. [[Cards/Structural Adaptation\|Structural Adaptation]] (e.g. venom, larger [[Cards/Ears\|Ears]])
2. [[Cards/Behavioural Adaptation\|Behavioural Adaptation]] (e.g. hibernation, instincts, [[Cards/The Tree of Knowledge Mutation\|The Tree of Knowledge Mutation]])
3. [[Cards/Physiological Adaptation\|Physiological Adaptation]] (e.g. ear sensitivity)
