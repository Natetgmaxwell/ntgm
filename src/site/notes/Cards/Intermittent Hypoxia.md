## Positive Effects of [[Cards/Intermittent Hypoxia\|Intermittent Hypoxia]]

> "First, IH enhances neurogenesis in adult [[Cards/Hippocampus\|hippocampus]]. Second, IH produces ADlike effects in multiple animal models screening for AD activity including the CMS paradigm, the FST, and the NSF test. Third, the AD-like effect of IH requires adult hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF since it could be blocked by selective inhibitions of neurogenesis and BDNFâ€“TrkB signaling in adult [[Cards/Hippocampus\|hippocampus]]. Together, these results identify a novel function of IH suggesting it could be developed as a potential AD therapy."
