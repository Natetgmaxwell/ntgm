## Flashcards

What are the two main types of thyroid hormone and how many [[Cards/Iodine\|iodine]] atoms do they contain?;;Thyroid hormone includes [[Cards/Thyroxine\|thyroxine]] (T4) with four [[Cards/Iodine\|iodine]] atoms and [[Cards/Triiodothyronine\|triiodothyronine]] (T3) with three [[Cards/Iodine\|iodine]] atoms. T3 is the more biologically active form.
