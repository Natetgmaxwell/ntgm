### A Blood Gas Analyser Measures Several Key Parameters in a Sample of Arterial Blood, Including:

1. **Partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)** - The amount of oxygen pressure in the blood.

2. **Partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)** - The amount of carbon dioxide pressure in the blood.

3. **pH** - A measure of acidity or basicity in the blood, with a lower pH indicating higher acidity and a higher pH indicating more basicity.

4. **Bicarbonate concentration (HCO3-)** - The level of bicarbonate ions in the blood, which helps buffer against changes in pH.

5. **Oxygen saturation (SaO2)** - The percentage of oxygen bound to hemoglobin in red blood cells.

These measurements help assess a patient's respiratory and acid-base status, aiding in diagnosing conditions like hypoxemia or respiratory acidosis.
