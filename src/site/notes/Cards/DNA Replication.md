> [!Definition] Definition
> [[Cards/DNA Replication\|DNA Replication]] is the process by which the [[Cards/Genomes\|Genome's]] [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] is replicated to be transferred into the new daughter cell.

## Can Be Broken into Two Stages
1. [[Cards/RNA Transcription\|RNA Transcription]]
2. [[Cards/RNA Splicing\|RNA Splicing]]

## Steps
1. [[Cards/Helicase\|Helicase]] unwinds the parental double helix
2. The leading strand is synthesised continuously in the 5'-> 3' direction by DNA [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]].
3. The lagging strand is synthesised discontinuously. [[Cards/Primase\|Primase]] synthesises a short [[Cards/Ribonucleic Acid\|RNA]], which is extended by [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]] to form an Okazaki fragment.
