1. [[Cards/Helicase\|Helicase]] unwinds the parental double helix
2. The leading strand is synthesised continuously in the 5'-> 3' direction by DNA [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]].
3. The lagging strand is synthesised discontinuously. [[Cards/Primase\|Primase]] synthesises a short [[Cards/Ribonucleic Acid\|RNA]], which is extended by [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]] to form an Okazaki fragment.
