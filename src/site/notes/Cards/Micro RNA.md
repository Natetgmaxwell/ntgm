## Flashcards

Describe the steps in the miRNA pathway;;1) miRNA forms hairpin loop, 2) Drosha cuts off non complementary regions, 3) Dicer slices the miRNA into 20-23bp chains, 4) formation of the RISC complex

Why are miRNAs good biomarkers?;;stability and specificity as miRNAs are highly specific to particular tissues
<!--SR:!2024-11-06,1,230-->

An RNA molecule from the host genome is transcribed and folds into a dsRNA structure, which RNAi pathway is most likely to be activated?;;miRNA
<!--SR:!2024-11-06,1,230-->

Which of the following best describes the function of miRNAs? (Removal of exons from pre-mRNA, To reduce the expression of their target genes, They are translated to form very small proteins, Eukaryotic transcription initiation);;To reduce the expression of their target genes.
