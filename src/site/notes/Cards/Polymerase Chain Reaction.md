# Polymerase Chain Reaction

> [!Definition] Definition
> [[Cards/Polymerase Chain Reaction\|PCR]] is a polmerase chain reaction that amplifies the amount of [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] available, allowing for further testing.

## The Replication Process

1. Separation of Strands through [[Cards/Denaturation\|Denaturation]] at about 95˚C
2. Cooling to about 65˚C allows the [[Cards/Primase\|Primase]] to join to the [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] showing the [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]] what to copy.
3. Warming up to 72˚C allowing [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]] to synthesis the opposing [[Cards/Chemical Bases\|Chemical Bases]].
4. The mixture is cooled allow the strands to form a double helix
