# Polymerase Chain Reaction

> [!Definition] Definition
> [[Cards/Polymerase Chain Reaction\|PCR]] is a polmerase chain reaction that amplifies the amount of [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] available, allowing for further testing.

## The Replication Process

1. Separation of Strands through [[Cards/Denaturation\|Denaturation]] at about 95˚C
2. Cooling to about 65˚C allows the [[Cards/Primase\|Primase]] to join to the [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|Deoxyribonucleic Acid]] showing the [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]] what to copy.
3. Warming up to 72˚C allowing [[Cards/Polymerase\|Polymerase]] to synthesis the opposing [[Cards/Nucleotide Bases\|Nucleotide Bases]].
4. The mixture is cooled allow the strands to form a double helix

What technique can be used to increase the amount of microbial [[Cards/Deoxyribonucleic Acid\|DNA]] so that it can be tested by [[Cards/Electrophoresis\|Electrophoresis]]?;;[[Cards/Polymerase Chain Reaction\|PCR]]
<!--SR:!2024-05-23,8,250-->

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction can be used for {{gene expression analysis}}

The migration of a PCR product through an agarose gel is dependent on?;;The size – the smaller the product the further it will migrate.
