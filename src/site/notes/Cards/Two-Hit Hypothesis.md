> [!Definition] Definition
> The two-hit hypothesis, proposed by Alfred Knudson, suggests that cancer develops when both copies of a TSG are inactivated or mutated. In the case of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome, the first "hit" is the inherited recessive loss of function mutation in the TSG. The second "hit" is a somatic mutation or loss of the remaining wild-type allele, which can occur spontaneously or due to environmental factors.
