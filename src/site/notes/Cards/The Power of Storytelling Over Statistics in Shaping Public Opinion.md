> Stories don’t care about your statistics.  In controlled experiments, researchers documented a pronounced  story-statistic gap in memory:  The average impact of statistics on beliefs fades by 73% over the  course of a day.  The impact of a story fades by only 32%. So in short, people's beliefs are more durably impacted by stories than  by statistics.  Huge implications for how voters’ beliefs can be more easily swayed  during the upcoming elections.
