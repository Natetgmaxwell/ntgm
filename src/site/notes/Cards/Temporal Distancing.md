# Temporal Distancing

> [!Definition] Definition
> Temporal distancing refers to the psychological process of viewing an event or experience as happening in the past, present, or future. It is the ability to detach oneself from the immediate experience and instead view it from a temporal perspective. Temporal distancing can be used to view a difficult or traumatic event as happening in the past, rather than as a current reality.
