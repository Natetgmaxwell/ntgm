# World War II

> [!Definition] Definition
> World War II, also known as the Second World War or WWII, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. It involved the majority of the world's nations, including all the major powers, organized into two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. The war was triggered by the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany, which prompted Britain and France to declare war on Germany. Soon after, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, drawing the United States into the conflict.
