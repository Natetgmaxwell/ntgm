# Rapamycin

> [!Definition] Definition
> Rapamycin is a drug that was *originally developed as an immunosuppressant* to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients. It was discovered in the 1970s in a soil sample taken from Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, which is where its name comes from.
> 
> Rapamycin works by *inhibiting a protein called [[Cards/mTOR\|mTOR]]* (mammalian target of rapamycin), which *plays a key role in regulating cell growth and [[Cards/Metabolism\|metabolism]]*. By inhibiting [[Cards/mTOR\|mTOR]], rapamycin can slow down or prevent certain cellular processes, which can have a range of effects on the body.
> 
> In addition to its immunosuppressive properties, rapamycin has been found to have a number of other potential health benefits, including anti-aging effects and improved immune function. However, rapamycin can also have side effects, and more research is needed to fully understand its potential benefits and risks.

> [!quote] Origins of [[Cards/Rapamycin\|Rapamycins]] name
> He named it rapamycin , after Rapa Nui, the native name for Easter Island ( mycin is the su ffix typically applied to antimicrobial agents).^[[[@peterattia2023OutliveScienceArt#^M4KZEKLWaTNJSBWD5p80\|[@peterattia2023OutliveScienceArt#^M4KZEKLWaTNJSBWD5p80]]]

> "One of the potential medications that can delay aging and long-term conditions includes rapamycin. This drug was initially approved as an anti-cancer and immunosuppressant for patients who underwent transplant surgery. Later, it was discovered that at high doses, it had been shown to rejuvenate immunity instead of suppressing it."

> "Understanding how rapamycin may prolong life goes back to how it interrupts the mTOR pathway. When this pathway is blocked, it promotes autophagy"
