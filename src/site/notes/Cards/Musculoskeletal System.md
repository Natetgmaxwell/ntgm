The musculoskeletal system is an indispensable component of the tissue and [[Cards/Organ Systems\|organ systems]] of the human body. The three principal types of muscle tissue are skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle groups. Skeletal muscle connects to the bone through [[Cards/Tendons\|tendons]] and collaboratively generates all bodily movements. The skeletal muscle fibres exhibit a characteristic striated appearance, owing to their fine red and white lines which are regularly arranged. As a result, they are commonly termed as striated muscles ([[Sources/Books/Anatomy Skeletal Muscle\|daveAnatomySkeletalMuscle2023]]).

Skeletal muscle is one of three types of muscle tissue in the body, the others being cardiac and smooth. As the name suggests, this type of muscle is used to articulate the skeleton. Another major component that differentiates skeletal from the other forms of muscle tissue is its ability to be consciously controlled ([[Sources/Books/Anatomy Skeletal Muscle\|daveAnatomySkeletalMuscle2023]]).
