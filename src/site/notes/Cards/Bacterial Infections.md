## Types of Bacterial Infections

There are many different types of bacterial infections that can affect various parts of the body. Some common examples are:

- [[Cards/Staphylococcal Infections\|Staphylococcal Infections]]: These are caused by a type of bacteria called [[Cards/Staphylococcus\|Staphylococcus]], which is normally present on the skin and mucous membranes. They can cause skin infections, such as pimples or boils, or more serious infections, such as pneumonia or toxic shock syndrome.
- [[Cards/Streptococcal Infections\|Streptococcal Infections]]: These are caused by a type of bacteria called [[Cards/Streptococcus\|Streptococcus]], which is also part of the normal skin flora. They can cause skin infections, such as cellulitis or impetigo, or more serious infections, such as rheumatic fever or glomerulonephritis.
- Lyme disease: This is caused by a type of bacteria called borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by ticks. It can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash. If left untreated, it can lead to joint pain, neurological problems, or heart damage.
- Tuberculosis: This is caused by a type of bacteria called mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is transmitted through the air. It can affect any part of the body, but most commonly causes lung infections that can be fatal if not treated.
- Meningitis: This is caused by various types of bacteria or viruses that invade the membranes that cover the brain and [[Cards/Spinal Cord\|Spinal Cord]]. It can cause symptoms such as fever, headache, stiff neck, and confusion. Bacterial meningitis is more serious than viral meningitis and requires immediate medical attention.
- Sepsis: This is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to infection causes organ damage or failure. It can be caused by any type of bacteria, but usually results from severe infections such as pneumonia or abdominal infections.
