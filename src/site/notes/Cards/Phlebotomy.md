## Steps for Collection of a [[Cards/Blood\|Blood]] Sample

1. Prepare the Collection Materials
	- Gather all necessary materials, such as a tourniquet, phlebotomy kit, and vacutainer tubes.
2. Explain the Procedure to the Patient
	- Inform the patient about the procedure, including its purpose, benefits, and potential side effects. Obtain their verbal consent.
3. Position the Patient Comfortably
	- Place the patient in a comfortable position, such as lying down on an examination table or sitting in a chair with their arm supported.
4. Clean the Vein Access Site
	- Use an alcohol swab to clean the area where the blood will be drawn. This helps minimise infection risk and ensures accurate vein location.
5. Apply Tourniquet
	- Securely wrap the tourniquet around the patient's upper arm, just above their elbow. This constricts the underlying veins, making them more visible and easier to access for blood collection.
6. Identify and Prepare the Vein
	- Locate a suitable vein using landmarks or by palpating the vein with your fingers. Clean the area where the needle will enter with an alcohol swab.
7. Insert the Needle into the Vein
	- Using aseptic technique, insert the phlebotomy needle into the chosen vein at a shallow angle. Ensure that you hit bone if you are unsure of correct placement.
8. Collect Blood in Vacutainer Tubes
	- Attach the vacutainer tubes to the needle's collection port and allow blood to flow into them. Fill each tube as per protocol, ensuring enough volume for analysis.
9. Remove Needle and Apply Pressure
	- Once all blood has been collected, remove the needle and apply pressure to the site using a sterile gauze pad or cotton ball. Hold pressure for several minutes until bleeding stops.
10. Label and Transport Blood Samples
	- Clearly label each vacutainer tube with the patient's name, date of collection, and any relevant information. Store them securely at an appropriate temperature before transporting to the laboratory for analysis.
