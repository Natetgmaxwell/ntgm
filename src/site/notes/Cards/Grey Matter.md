> [!Definition] Definition
> Grey matter is a type of [[Cards/Nervous Tissue\|Nervous Tissue]] found in the [[Cards/Brain\|Brain]] and [[Cards/Spinal Cord\|Spinal Cord]] that contains the cell bodies, [[Cards/Dendrites\|Dendrites]], and [[Cards/Axons\|axon]] terminals of neurons, as well as [[Cards/Neuroglia\|glial cells]] and [[Cards/Blood Vessels\|blood vessels]]. It is named for its greyish colour, which comes from the presence of densely packed neuronal cell bodies and their associated dendrites and axon terminals.
