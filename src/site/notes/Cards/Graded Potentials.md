What are graded potentials?;; Graded potentials are small local changes in membrane potential away from [[Cards/Resting Membrane Potential\|Resting Membrane Potential]], resulting from ion channel opening or closing in response to stimuli.
<!--SR:!2024-10-01,29,170-->

How is a [[Cards/Graded Potentials\|Graded Potential]] stimulated?;;by the binding of a ligand to a [[Cards/Chemically Gated Ion Channels\|Chemically Gated Ion Channel]] or the activation of a [[Cards/Mechanically Gated Ion Channels\|Mechanically Gated Ion Channel]] through force. Allowing influx of sodium ions and outflux of potassium ions, resulting the the depolarisation of the membrane.

A receptor potential?;;can be directly proportional to stimulus strength.
