> [!Definition] Definition
> Muscle tissue is a type of tissue in animals that is responsible for movement. It is made up of specialized cells called muscle fibers, which have the ability to contract and relax, generating force and producing movement.

### [[Cards/Epithelial Tissue\|Epithelial Tissue]]

> [!Definition] Definition
> Epithelial tissue is a type of tissue that lines the surfaces of the body, both internal and external. It forms the outer layer of the [[Cards/Skin\|skin]], as well as the lining of the respiratory, digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts. Epithelial tissue is made up of closely packed cells, and its main functions are to protect the body from physical and chemical damage, regulate the exchange of substances between the body and its environment, and secrete and absorb substances.

> [!Definition] Definition
> Nervous tissue is a highly specialised tissue that enables communication and control within the body. It is composed of [[Cards/Neurons\|neurons]] and [[Cards/Neuroglia\|glial cells]], and is responsible for processing and transmitting information via electrical and chemical signals.
