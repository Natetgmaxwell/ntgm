## Flashcards

What is a solution?;;A solution is a homogeneous mixture composed of a solute (substance being dissolved) and a solvent (the dissolving medium).
<!--SR:!2023-10-15,3,150-->

Differentiate between solutes and solvents in a solution;;Solutes are substances that are dissolved in a solvent, while the solvent is the liquid in which the solutes are dissolved.
<!--SR:!2023-10-17,4,150-->

Explain the difference between an unsaturated and [[Cards/Saturated Solution\|saturated solution]];;An [[Cards/Unsaturated Solution\|unsaturated solution]] can dissolve more solute at a given temperature, while a [[Cards/Saturated Solution\|saturated solution]] has dissolved the maximum amount of solute possible at that temperature.
<!--SR:!2023-10-15,3,150-->

How do you calculate solution concentrations and perform dilutions?;;Concentration is calculated as the amount of solute divided by the volume of the solution. [[Cards/Dilution of Solutions\|Dilution]] involves adding more solvent to decrease concentration.
